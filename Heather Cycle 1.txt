Response2:: I don't know if my passion is coffee, exactly... But! I do enjoy being hospitable and helping people start their days.[]It helps to start your day with a smiling face. I'm more than happy to provide the smile!

Option1b:: You chose a good place to open shop!

Response1a:: He should have plenty of business now that I'm here. I saw he has two little girls with him, too.[]Not that I was spying or anything! I'm not <i>that</i> nosy, heh. I just like to know where my money is going.

Response1b:: The opportunity sort of fell into my lap, actually. I was just passing through on my way to the bigger cities farther west, but then I saw the caf√© was available.[]And it was so cute! I just had to buy it up. I only hope my investment has a nice return... I hope you drink a lot of coffee!
