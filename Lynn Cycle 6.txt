Lynn Cycle 6

Dialogue:: XX! I'm glad you're here, I could use a friendly face. I've been pretty stressed out...

Option1:: Maybe a walk on the beach would relax you.

Option2:: Why don't we meet up together? Sounds like we could both use it.


Response1:: I've only been down there once. Maybe I should spend more time in nature. What do you think?

Response2:: Oh! Wow, just... the two of us? That sounds nice! Let's do it.


Option1a:: Nature helps to clear your head, sometimes.

Option1b:: Nature won't help with your stress. Maybe you should talk to Jun.

Response1a:: Well, it's certainly a better solution than no solution at all. Thanks XX, I'll give it a shot.

Response1b:: Oh yeah, he's the counselor right? I don't know if I could do that, though. Just open up to a complete stranger... but maybe it wouldn't be so bad.


Option2a:: Tomorrow, then? //Quest none LynnHangout1Quest

Option2b:: On second thought, we better not. //Relationship Lynn6 -1 Embarrassed

Response2a:: Yeah! I think I already know where we should go. Just meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 10:00 am!

Response2b:: Now that you mention it, I suppose you're right.
