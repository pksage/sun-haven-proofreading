Dialogue:: Ugh. Hello again, XX. I'm a bit busy right now, can you try and keep this quick?

Option1:: Anything I could do to help?

Option1a:: Sometimes your job is hard to envy.
Option1b:: You sure do have a lot of stuff to do.

Response2a:: Oh yes, XX. Thank you for the reminder. Trust me, I didn't need it.
