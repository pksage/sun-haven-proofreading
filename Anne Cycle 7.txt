Dialogue:: Well if it isn't one of my favorite people in Sun Haven![]Actually, I say that for a lot of customers. But for you it's kind of true!

I'm keeping the other, but I want you to have this one. You're becoming a good friend and I guess I want to show you that it means something to me.[]But you better not lose this! Just stick it in your pocket or something, as long as it's safe.
