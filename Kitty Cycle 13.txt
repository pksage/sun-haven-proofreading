Option1:: By the way, why do you love animals so much?

Option2:: What's your dream pet, Kitty?


Response1:: They're so sweet and funny. And did you know each one has their own unique personality? Plus plus, I can talk as much as I want and they don't leave as long as I have food for them.

Response2:: Ooooh, dream pet? XX, that's a tough tough question... No it's not! A White Lion would be my top top choice.[]White Lions are majestic and fast and strong - just like me! Except, maybe stronger... and a loooot bigger.
