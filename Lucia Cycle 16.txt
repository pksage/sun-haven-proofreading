Lucia Cycle 16

Dialogue:: First I was blessed, then I became Archmage, and now I'm married... More and more, it seems like my fate is simply tied to Sun Haven.

Option1:: It's a good thing you like it here!
Option2:: Do you really believe in fate?

Response1:: XX, that is being deceptively modest. I wouldn't say I simply like it here - Sun Haven will forever be my home. I am in love with this place!
Response2:: I certainly do, XX. It's important for a leader to believe in a grand purpose. Otherwise, why should she bother leading in the first place?

Option1a:: It has been good to you, huh?
Option1b:: You have a lot of memories here.

Response1a:: To be completely candid, I meant it when I said my fate is tied to this town. I truly believe that, were I to leave Sun Haven, then I would be leaving behind all the goodness in my life.
Response1b:: To be completely candid, I meant it when I said my fate is tied to this town. I truly believe that, were I to leave Sun Haven, then I would be leaving behind all the goodness in my life.

Option2a:: Leadership gets you power. //Relationship Lucia16 -1 Mad
Option2b:: That's a thoughtful point, Lucia. //Relationship Lucia16 2 Happy

Response2a:: Any person who craves power merely for the sake of being powerful is weak in the mind.
Response2b:: Thank you, dear XX. Without purpose, we would all be like sparks in the air - aimless, and quick to burn out.
