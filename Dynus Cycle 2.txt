Dialogue:: You've returned... Speak, or cease wasting my time.

Option1:: What do you get from the offerings?
Option2:: How old are you?

Response1:: Offerings placed into the altar give me power... similar to the gems below me.[]More importantly... it reminds my inferiors where they belong. I try to avoid needless cruelty... to those who revere me.
Response2:: Age is irrelevant to my life... I've ceased counting the decades that drift by.

Option1a:: So you rely on the power that is given to you?
Option1b:: I'll prove myself to you.

Response1a:: I rely only on myself... Do not test me, puny hero. The offerings add little to my power... but I get satisfaction from the devotion of my subjects.
Response1b:: We shall see... and hurry.


Option2a:: So you don't even know how much longer you'll live? //Relationship Dynus2 -1

Option2b:: You must be powerful if you've surpassed time. //Relationship Dynus2 2


Response2a:: Simple-minded weakling... Something as simple as time has no influence on a being as powerful as I am.
Response2b:: Centuries ago, I defeated a race who refused to serve me... they knew me by a fitting title... <i>Dominus Mortis</i>... Master of Death.
