Nathaniel Cycle 17

Dialogue:: Sometimes I see Roza's sword and think I should get an upgrade... What do you think, XX?

Option1:: You shouldn't compare.
Option2:: Why does she have such a big sword anyway?

Response1:: Heh, you almost sound like my mother. You're right, anyway. Her sword is just so <i>big</i>.
Response2:: In battle, she uses her sword as a shield in a tight spot. I've seen it in action, Roza switches between offense and defense in the blink of an eye.[]It's a big part of why I made her my second-in-command. Not just because she's tough, but because she's smart.

Option1a:: Your sword is a little dinky. //Relationship Nathaniel17 -1 Sad
Option1b:: You know that doesn't matter. //Relationship Nathaniel17 2 Happy

Response1a:: I knew it... the soldiers must have been laughing at me this whole time.
Response1b:: You're right, you're right. A sword is only as sharp as the soldier that holds it.

Option2a:: Have you ever sparred with her?  //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: That's a ridiculous strategy.

Response2a:: Heh, actually I haven't. And I don't plan to! There's no point in making me look bad in front of the soldiers.
Response2b:: You say that, but you haven't seen her in battle. Trust me XX, she knows what she's doing.
