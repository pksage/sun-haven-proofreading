Darius Cycle P14

Dialogue:: Greetings, XX. Now get out of my way.

Option1:: I didn't mean to get in your way.
Option2:: You seem cranky! Well, more than usual.

Response1:: Regardless of your intent, you did it all the same. I'm busy right now with a task from my father... and I loathe being tasked with my father's demands.
Response2:: Judge me all you want, but I have matters to tend to that go far above you. At any rate, I need not explain myself to the likes of you.[]My father has his wishes, and it's up to me to respect them no matter what. Now like I said, get out of my way.

Option1a:: What's Minos got you doing? //Emote none Mad
Option1b:: You do look a bit stressed.

Response1a:: Firstly, it's King Minos to you. Secondly, it's not of your concern. 
Response1b:: Then you should know that if there was ever a time to trifle with me, it is not now. Not that there's <i>ever</i> a time you should trifle with me.

Option2a:: Right this way, my prince. //Relationship DariusP14 2
Option2b:: That's no reason to be rude. //Relationship DariusP14 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Heh, that's more like it. I'm just in a hurry, but I knew you had the wits to understand that. 
Response2b:: I might count you as something akin to a confidant, XX, but if you become a problem... well, you know the drill. Dungeon. Chains. Eternity.[]Now move aside.
