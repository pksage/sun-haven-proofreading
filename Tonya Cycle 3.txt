Dialogue:: There's Sun Haven's favorite farmer!

Option1:: Actually, I'm Sun Haven's only farmer.
Option2:: If I'm Sun Haven's favorite farmer, then you're it's favorite courier!

Response1:: Exactly! So you must also be the favorite, right?[]Running mail all the way out to your farm is great for my morning routine, at any rate.
Response2:: You're darn right I am! You show me someone who delivers mail faster than I can, and I'll eat one of Giuseppe's sculptures.

Option1a:: I'm glad to be of help! //Relationship Tonya3 2
Option1b:: So I'm only the favorite farmer by default, huh? //Relationship Tonya3 -1

Response1a:: I'm glad, too! My routine was getting a little too easy.
Response1b:: Oh, don't sound so insulted. At least people like you!

Option2b:: You're so fit, it's hard to picture someone faster than you.

Response2a:: Well not really, XX. I wouldn't even know how to start... Maybe with a fork and hammer?
