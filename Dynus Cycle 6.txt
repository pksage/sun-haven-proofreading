Dynus Cycle 6

Dialogue:: You've returned... Speak, or cease wasting my time.

Option1:: What will you do once you've conquered your empire?
Option2:: Are you able to grant a blessing?

Response1:: I will do what rulers do... rule. As my power grows... my opposition will be terminated.
Response2:: I can, but I choose not to... why waste gifts on those who are too incompetent to use them?

Option1a:: It sounds pointless to me. //Relationship Dynus6 -1
Option1b:: Only a fool would try to resist you. //Relationship Dynus6 2

Response1a:: I'm unsurprised that a whelp like you... wouldn't comprehend my dominion.
Response1b:: Others before have tried resisting... and they failed.

Option2a:: Not even the Demons?
Option2b:: What about me?

Response2a:: The Demons... are capable enough on their own. If they needed my blessing... they would have had nothing to offer me...
Response2b:: Were the blessings you received from the so-called 'guardian dragons'... not enough for you? At least you understand... the desire for power.
