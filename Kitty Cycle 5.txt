Kitty Cycle 5

Dialogue:: Kitty had a nightmare last night... I was climbing a tree all grown up, but I got stuck like I did as a kitten!

Option1:: I'm sure you're strong enough to get back down now!

Option2:: Maybe Catherine can help you with those nightmares.


Response1:: What if it's a warning that I shouldn't be climbing trees anymore? Oh, that would make Kitty sad!

Response2:: Like with magical herbs, nya? I don't like Catherine's potions too much. They taste so... yuck! Nasty.


Option1a:: Don't be sad, I'm sure you won't get stuck. //Emote none Happy

Option1b:: You'll be okay, but maybe you can climb shorter trees for now, just in case!

Response1a:: You're right, I'm a pretty good climber now, nya! So nice to have a sunny friend cheering me on. Thanks, XX!

Response1b:: You're right, nya! Gosh, you're so clever, XX! 


Option2a:: You should just deal with it if you want to avoid the nightmares. //Relationship Kitty5 -1 Sad

Option2b:: It's true... Maybe she could make one that tastes like berries? //Relationship Kitty5 2 Happy

Response2a:: Ugh, I'd rather have nightmares, nyan...

Response2b:: Oh! Or fish! I think I'll go ask her to try, nya. Good idea, XX!
