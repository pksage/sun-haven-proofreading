Dugan Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome back - what'd ya say yer name was? - right, XX!

Option1:: How come I haven't seen any other Cyclops?
Option2:: Are you really an archer?

Response1:: We're a dyin' breed! Problem is, we Cyclops are too infatuated by folks with two eyes. Then when we have babies - they come out with two eyes as well! 'Tis a shame, but a shame of our own makin'.
Response2:: An archer? Sure, I could be! Never really tried a'fore, to be perfectly honest with ya.

Option1a:: Why don't you just marry other Cyclops?
Option1b:: Follow your heart and everything will work out.

Response1a:: I would, if not fer that pink-haired mermaid... She slips by every day, and every day she smiles as she goes... I'd give up my one and only eye fer her, and I mean that!
Response1b:: Thanks kid. That's what I keep tellin' meself, but the fact is, Cyclops numbers are still droppin'.[]Aw heck, who knows? Maybe there's a commune with dozens of families out there that I just don't know about! 

Option2a:: Then why do you run this game?
Option2b:: Doesn't that make you kind of a phoney?

Response2a:: S'only a job, kiddo. Sorry if that disappoints ya, but I need t'make ends meet, now don't I?
Response2b:: Phoney?! Yer lucky I really ain't an archer, else I'd have you stuck like a pincushion!
