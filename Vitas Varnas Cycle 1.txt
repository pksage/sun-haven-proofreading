Vitas Varnas Cycle 0

Dialogue:: Hello there. I believe last time we spoke I was busy thinking, and never properly introduced myself. I'm free now if you'd like to have a chat.

Option1:: So, who are you?
Option2:: What are you doing here in Sun Haven?

Response1:: My name is Vitas Varnas, explorer and scholar. I've traveled through many different lands in pursuit of my research - lands you couldn't even imagine!
Response2:: I've heard a lot about Sun Haven, enough to pack a bag and check it out. Even with all that I've seen and everywhere that I've been, my path brought me here. My hope is that Sun Haven will help me find what I'm searching for.

Option1a:: Is that your real name? 
Option1b:: That's a strange name.

Response1a:: It <i>is</i>  an exotic name, isn't it? Maybe it's a false identity! Heh, I'll leave it to you to discover the truth.
Response1b:: It <i>is</i>  an exotic name, isn't it? Maybe it's a false identity! Heh, I'll leave it to you to discover the truth.

Option2a:: I hope you find what you're looking for, Vitas. //Relationship VitasVarnas1 1
Option2b:: Your adventure sounds boring. //Relationship VitasVarnas1 -1

Response2a:: Much thanks! My journey has been a long one, I predict it still has a long ways to go.
Response2b:: I'm sorry to hear you say that. Perhaps I should keep more to myself from now on.
