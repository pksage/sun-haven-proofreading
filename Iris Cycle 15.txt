Iris Cycle 15

Dialogue:: There you are, XX. I thought living with somebody would become a chore, but it's just the opposite with you.

Option1:: I'm just thinking of our future together.
Option2:: Are you happy in our relationship, Iris?

Response1:: Good thoughts, I hope?
Response2:: I never thought I'd be so happy, if you want me to be honest. I don't want to imagine a future without you in it, XX.

Option1a:: <i>Very</i> good thoughts, Iris. 
Option1b:: The future I see for us is nothing but goodness.

Response1a:: Thank goodness... I got a little worried there, XX! Be careful when you do that to me.
Response1b:: Thank goodness... I got a little worried there, XX! Be careful when you do that to me.

Option2a:: That's exactly how I feel. //Relationship Iris15 2 Happy
Option2b:: I don't think our relationship is that serious. //Relationship Iris15 -1 Sad

Response2a:: If you feel the same way, then I see no reason to not take our relationship even further. If you're truly ready for that, of course. Oh, now my heart is racing... 
Response2b:: I thought we were on the same page about this... I don't know how I was so wrong.
