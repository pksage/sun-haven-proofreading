Wornhardt Cycle 12

Dialogue:: Hey, XX, I think I overheard someone talking about us in the tavern last night.[]I hate when people talk behind my back...

Option1:: Does it make you that uncomfortable?

Option2:: You should do your best to ignore it.


Response1:: Kind of, but it's not important. I guess I never thought I would be worth gossiping about again.[]But if you're asking whether I like the attention or not? Not really, that doesn't do anything for me.

Response2:: I know, and I do try my best. Some things just get under my skin. I've got a sore history with gossip, is all.


Option1a:: No way, I think you love the attention! //Relationship Wornhardt12 -1 Mad

Option1b:: I figured - you don't exactly love the spotlight. //Relationship Wornhardt12 2 Happy

Response1a:: Well, you're just plain wrong about me, then.

Response1b:: Heh, I guess you've gotten to know me pretty well. I'm glad, XX.


Option2a:: You and I can gossip about everyone in town to get back at them.  //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: Who was it?

Response2a:: Heh, I don't think that will be necessary. Thank you for the laugh, though, XX.

Response2b:: Oh, Calvin and some guards. I guess I shouldn't be surprised - Calvin is always talking about other people.
