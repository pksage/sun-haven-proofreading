Lucia Cycle 11 

Dialogue:: Excuse me if I seem short of breath, XX. I was just practicing some fireballs at home.

Option1:: You practice fire magic in your house?

Option2:: Lucia, how strong is your magic, really?


Response1:: Yes, I have a training area beneath my house. It's perfect for practicing my spells. Grandfather used to call them "fire drills."[]The next time you visit my home, you should look closely at my owl statue!

Response2:: As a matter of fact, I've mastered fire magic since I was blessed by Elios. But that doesn't quite answer the question, does it? Oh, I have a story for you![]A few years ago, I found a fledgling dragon tangled in brambles. It was quite scared, spouting flames in every direction. I wanted to help, but it wouldn't allow me to. So I established dominance.[]Every time the dragon spat fire my way, I responded with a larger burst of flame. Eventually, the young dragon submitted and allowed me to set it free!


Option1a:: A secret training area? Isn't that a little overboard?

Option1b:: You're like a hero from a novel!  //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1a:: It's not so much a secret as it is safe. It was important for me to have a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!

Response1b:: Oh! Hah, I don't know if I would say that. I only needed a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!


Option2a:: You beat a dragon? That's amazing! //Relationship Lucia11 2 Happy

Option2b:: That story doesn't make you sound so tough. //Relationship Lucia11 -1 Mad

Response2a:: It was merely a fledgling, but still quite a challenge! Besides, you never really doubted my strength, right, XX?

Response2b:: I'll keep that in mind the next time you're fighting a dragon!
