Beeanca Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Let's see... what shall I do first today? Collect nectar, or perhaps sort pollen? Oh, so much to do!

Option1:: Could I help you with anything?
Option2:: What do you have to do today?

Response1:: You're an absolute doll to ask, and please don't take it this the wrong way...[]But unless you suddenly shrink in size, sprout wings, and turn into a bee - there is no way you are capable of helping me with my work.
Response2:: Goodness, where do I begin? Well, I need to collect nectar, color coordinate the pollen, process the nectar, jar the honey, make sure the bees take their nap, un-color coordinate the pollen...[]...Scrub yesterday's honey jars, water all of the flowers, align the pollen alphabetically, send out the evening crew to do a nectar run of the evening's flowers, plan the morning crew's flight path...[]...Un-align the pollen alphabetically, prepare the jars for tomorrow's honey run...

Option1a:: Oh. Fair enough. //Relationship Beeanca4 2
Option1b:: You don't know that. //Relationship Beeanca4 -1

Response1a:: Sorry, honey. Thanks for understanding, though. And don't worry! I've got everything all under control.
Response1b:: Oh, but I <i>do</i>. Only bees are specialized for the work bees do. It's called nature, honey. Read a book about it sometime.

Option2a:: I'm sorry I asked...
Option2b:: How do you do it all?!

Response2a:: Hey, you asked, honey.
Response2b:: Very quickly and with lots and lots of tiny little helpers.
