Clay Cycle 1

Dialogue:: So what, you have a question for me or something?

Option1:: Are you Amari?
Option2:: Why are you wearing pots?

Response1:: Last I checked, yeah. What, don't I look it?
Response2:: What's wrong with it? Maybe it's no good as real armor, but I don't need any real armor here.

Option1a:: You don't seem like the others. //Relationship Clay1 2
Option1b:: You haven't been here long, have you? //Relationship Clay1 -1

Response1a:: Aw, I'm still not talking right huh? Wesley told me my tone of voice is too rough for this place. I get that it's a nice town and all, but people gotta let people be themselves.
Response1b:: Actually, I used to live in a place called Withergate. Then I got lost and ended up in the forest near here where Rel'Tar picked me up. I was surprised to see Amari and Elves living so nicely with each other, so I just had to stay!

Option2a:: At least you like it.
Option2b:: It looks weird.

Response2a:: I like it plenty. One of the Elves said it suits me, so I stuck with it. Maybe that's a weak argument, but it's not every day I get a compliment like that.
Response2b:: Well I like it plenty. One of the Elves said it suits me, so I stuck with it. Maybe that's a weak argument, but it's not every day I get a compliment like that.
