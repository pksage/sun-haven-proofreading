Solon Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Good to see you, farmer. You're putting on some muscle. About time.


Option1:: I guess I am a little stronger these days.

Option2:: What's the most difficult job you ever took?


Response1:: Wear your muscles with pride, kid. They're the trophies of your hard work.

Response2:: Most difficult? Hm. Guess it must've been about a year back. Customer walks in wanting mithril armor - for her bird.[]Guess she trained some kind of eagle to follow her into battle.


Option1a:: Calling your muscles trophies is kind of silly. //Relationship Solon4 -1

Option1b:: I don't like to gloat. //Relationship Solon4 2

Response1a:: You think it's silly to work your hands raw for three decades? I didn't think so.

Response1b:: Heh, well that's good. But I'm not telling you to gloat. You can be proud of yourself and humble to others at the same time.[]I don't call myself a master, but I don't deny it either. Just keep working hard, kid.


Option2a:: What did you do? 

Option2b:: Is it even possible to make armor for a bird? 

Response2a:: Fulfilled the order, of course. I had to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril. 

Response2b:: It is if you know your metal. I had to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril.
