Liam Cycle P14

Dialogue:: Elizabeth made a painting of me the other day. She's so adorable, and Jun loaned her some of his paints! I really need to thank him, but I'm just not sure how...

Option1:: Why don't you know how to thank Jun?
Option2:: Elizabeth must really love you to paint a picture of you. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1:: I mean, I'm really grateful he let Elizabeth use his paints. It was very kind of him, but... how do I thank him the right way?[]What if I try to get him a thank you gift and he doesn't like it? Oh, that'd be so awkward!
Response2:: Shucks! Both my sisters love me! And I love them, too. Still, though, when I saw Elizabeth's little painting of me, I almost cried a little.[]Ah, I can't believe I just told you that!

Option1a:: Just let him know what it means to you, that'd be enough. //Relationship LiamP14 2 Happy
Option1b:: If you're that worried, then don't do anything. //Relationship LiamP14 -1 Sad

Response1a:: You think so, XX? Yeah, I guess you're right. Jun is a really peaceful guy, he wouldn't really be expecting a gift as a thank you. Hm, maybe a fresh batch of rolls though?[]That seems like a fair gift in exchange for paint, I think.
Response1b:: That's even worse! I'm going to worry about this all night, now! All this over a painting, yeesh!

Option2a:: Don't be embarrassed, Liam. //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2b:: Everyone knows you love your sisters, it's no big deal. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response2a:: Easier said than done! My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
Response2b:: I know everyone knows, but it's still a little embarrassing to cry at a painting, isn't it? My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
