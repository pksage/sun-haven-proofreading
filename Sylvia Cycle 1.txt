Sylvia Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome! Come to see the world's finest craftsmanship?


Option1:: What makes this the world's finest?

Option2:: What a cute deer!


Response1:: Nobody compares to Elves when it comes to woodcraft, don't you know?

Response2:: That's Telumbe, he's really smart. He knows the way back home to Nel'Vari by heart.


Option1a:: I'm surprised to see such skill from Elves as young as you. //Relationship Sylvia1 -1

Option1b:: It's because you live in the forest, right? //Relationship Sylvia1 2

Response1a:: Just because we're young doesn't mean we aren't skilled! Why does everyone make that assumption?

Response1b:: Sort of. We have a connection with trees, so we understand the wood better than anyone else.


Option2a:: Can I pet him?  

Option2b:: He sounds like a one-of-a-kind animal. 

Response2a:: Sorry, I should get back to work and help Sylvius. He will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.

Response2b:: He really is! Anyway, I should get back to work. Sylvius will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.
