Xyla Cycle 3

Dialogue:: Look here, it's the Withergate Wannabe! You just can't stay away can you?

Option1:: Do you have any plans for Withergate?

Option2:: So you like it in Withergate? //Emote none Happy


Response1:: One word: expansion. I've clearly done a bang-up job with the space we have here, but I want to see Withergate become a real metropolis!

Response2:: If I didn't, don't you think I'd leave? Of course I like it here! In a city of dimwitted monsters and demons, a person like me can have a lot of fun.


Option1a:: That seems a little idealistic. //Relationship Xyla3 -1 Mad

Option1b:: A monster metropolis, huh? If anyone can do it, it would be you. //Relationship Xyla3 2 Happy

Response1a:: Idealistic is thinking you can snap off little comments like that without getting called out. Seriously outsider, who do you think you're talking to?

Response1b:: You've got an eye for aptitude. You're sharper than you look, outsider.


Option2a:: That sounds a little mean.

Option2b:: You definitely have confidence going for you.

Response2a:: No need to get your feelings hurt, outsider. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings or anything. If I was, you would know it.

Response2b:: Take it from me, confidence will take you places in this town. Flattery, on the other hand, will not... Unless you catch me on a good day.
