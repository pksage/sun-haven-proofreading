Jun Cycle 14

Dialogue:: Feeling well today? It looks like you got good sleep last night.

Option1:: I dreamed I was flying with dragon's wings. Did you dream?

Option2:: You always notice me, Jun. I'm lucky to have someone as mindful as you.


Response1:: Dragon wings? Mine definitely wasn't as adventurous as yours.[]In my dream I was a cloud in the sky watching all the people in town below. I could even see into their homes, like dollhouses. It was strange, but also quite unique.

Response2:: XX, I noticed you right away. How could I not? I feel like the lucky one here!


Option1a:: Yeah, that's not quite so adventurous.

Option1b:: That sounds kind of fun!

Response1a:: Maybe next time I'll join you in the sky with dragon's wings. One can only hope!

Response1b:: You think so? Part of me thinks so too. It's too bad we aren't clouds in the sky, XX.


Option2a:: Strange, I didn't really notice you until we started talking. //Relationship Jun14 -1 Sad

Option2b:: I noticed you on my first day here, too. //Relationship Jun14 2 Happy

Response2a:: Oh, huh. Not even once? That's a little disappointing...

Response2b:: Is that true? So we were sneaking glances at each other from the very beginning? That's too cute!
