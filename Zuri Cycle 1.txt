Zuri Cycle 1

Dialogue:: How's tricks?

Option1:: Why are you running this Ferris wheel, anyway?
Option2:: How did you end up here?

Response1:: I used to loooove Ferris wheels as a living girl. I guess even in the afterlife some things never change, eh?
Response2:: After I passed, I finally had time to visit all the theme parks I'd dreamed of visiting. It's a lot cheaper when you're dead![]I finally found Withergate's carnival, and it's the best one I've seen by far. I figure, why not stick around and enjoy it, eh?

Option1a:: Don't you think it's time to move on? //Relationship Zuri1 -1
Option1b:: I love the Ferris wheel, too. //Relationship Zuri1 2

Response1a:: Nah, but maybe it's time for <i>you</i> to move on.
Response1b:: Glad to see someone still appreciates the classic rides. The view from the top is too good to pass up!

Option2a:: You don't want to "pass on?"
Option2b:: So you're just going to work in the carnival forever?

Response2a:: Mm, there's plenty of time for that later. I mean, what's the rush? It's my afterlife, I figure I can spend it how I like.
Response2b:: Not forever, just for a while. Maybe a few hundred years or so. I mean, what's the rush? It's my afterlife, I figure I can spend it how I like.
