Dialogue:: Solon acts a little gruff, but he's such a sweetheart. Ever since our marriage, he's seemed extra proud of me.

Option1:: Solon is right to be proud of you.

Option2:: Solon must see you kind of like a daughter.


Response1:: You think so, XX? I've come a really long way with my skills since moving to Sun Haven. It's good to be recognized by two of the most important people to me.

Response2:: It's so cute, but I think so too! Thinking back on it, when I first arrived in Sun Haven, Solon really seemed to help me settle in and adjust.[]I didn't really recognize it at the time, but I think he really wanted to help me out. I'm so lucky to have found so many great people here!


Option1a:: Think you'll ever be better than your foremothers?

Option1b:: Think you'll ever be better than Solon?

Response1a:: Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! My mother and grandmother are both so awesome at their work, I don't want to think of how far behind I still must be![]I'm just going to take it one day at a time, and not focus on how far away I am! Solon is a great teacher, I know I'll get there someday.

Response1b:: Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! Solon is probably the single most skilled blacksmith I've ever met! But he <i>is</i> teaching me, after all.[]Maybe it's inevitable that I'll surpass him eventually. The student becomes the teacher, right? Solon is a great teacher, so I know I'll get there someday.


Option2a:: I'm glad you found happiness in Sun Haven. //Relationship Lynn17 2 Happy

Option2b:: Don't you ever want something more?  //Relationship Lynn17 -1

Response2a:: I found more than just happiness. I found the rest of my life! I never wanted too much, but building a life with you and working with Solon is more than enough.

Response2b:: Ooh, I know, it's tradition for my village!! You can't ever tell my mother, alright? She'd never let me hear the end of it!
