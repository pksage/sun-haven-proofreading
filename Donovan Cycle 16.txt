Donovan Cycle 16

Dialogue:: Wow... I can't believe it! I just saw you and thought, "I'm MARRIED to this person!"

Option1:: How does it feel? //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2:: Did you think you'd ever get married?

Response1:: It's weird! It's weird, right? Or am I blowing this out of proportion? 
Response2:: It definitely wasn't in the plan. Then again, I didn't really have a plan, either. So I guess if there never was a plan... at least it wasn't against the plan?

Option1a:: It's definitely weird. //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: I don't think it's weird at all.

Response1a:: I'm glad you think so, too. At least it's weird together, right? 
Response1b:: I guess it's different for someone like me. Settling down feels weird. That's what people call it, right? We're "settling down?"

Option2a:: I love your logic. //Relationship Donovan16 2 Happy
Option2b:: That makes no sense. //Relationship Donovan16 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Hah, if you can call it that! It works for me, anyway. I've made some of my best decisions using flawed logic. Like marrying you! 
Response2b:: I know the logic is flawed, but at least try to stay with me here.
