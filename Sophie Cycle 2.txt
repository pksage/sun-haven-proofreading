Sophie Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hey XX, is it true that you moved here from the Great City? I bet that place is amazing.


Option1:: The Great City is nice, if you like cities.

Option2:: Where are you from, Sophie?


Response1:: I don't know if I like cities. I've only ever seen regular towns like this.

Response2:: I came all the way from the north. Well, it was the southern part of the Northern Region, if you follow me.


Option1a:: You're not missing much.

Option1b:: You should try to travel more.

Response1a:: Do you really think that? Hm. I believe you, but I still want to see for myself one day.

Response1b:: That's actually part of what made me join the military, so I could travel more. I guess I didn't expect to be stationed in the same town for five years...


Option2a:: I've heard nice things about the north. //Relationship Sophie2 2

Option2b:: I've heard terrible things about the north. //Relationship Sophie2 -1

Response2a:: Like with any place, the north has its good parts and its bad parts.[]I'm sure you've heard, but the weather is brutal. On the other hand, I never met someone on the road that was too busy to help when you need it.
