Wornhardt Cycle P14

Dialogue:: Lucia honored me with a medal of recognition for my work the other day. Sorry, I'm not bragging, I'm just kind of touched, is all.

Option1:: You totally deserved it. //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2:: So what's your medal look like?

Response1:: You think so, too? I work real hard and everything, but I can't shake the feeling this honor could've gone to someone... more deserving. Did I really earn it?
Response2:: Ah, it's really beautiful. I'd show it to you, but I've put it away for safekeeping.[]It's a golden emblem with Elios' likeness carved into it, along with the words "FOR SERVICE TO SUN HAVEN."[]Lucia's signature is also engraved on it, which is a nice touch.

Option1a:: Don't doubt yourself so much, you're doing great. //Relationship WornhardtP14 2 Happy
Option1b:: So you think Lucia made a mistake? //Relationship WornhardtP14 -1 Sad

Response1a:: I know I shouldn't be down on myself, but sometimes it's hard... though if you and the Archmage are telling me I'm doing great, then maybe I should listen![]Heh, thanks for the shot of confidence, XX.
Response1b:: Lucia is a very wise Archmage, I never implied she was mistaken. I'm just not sure <i>why</i> it was me. Don't get the wrong idea, XX.

Option2a:: Sounds fancy. //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2b:: You should frame it.

Response2a:: It's certainly a thing to behold. I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
Response2b:: I may just have to do that one of these days. Right now I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
