Sable Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Are you a fast swimmer? I bet you're even faster than Rel'Tar!

Option1:: What makes you ask that?
Option2:: Rel'Tar?

Response1:: I want to go swimming, but I can't because my wings won't work anymore. So I ask people about swimming instead!
Response2:: Yeah, the crossbow man! He swims fast, but he used to be faster. That's what he says, anyway.[]Rel'Tar is nice, but he gets real angry when I play with his crossbows, hehe.

Option1a:: If you could, I bet you'd be a fast swimmer. //Relationship Sable1 2
Option1b:: You should stop talking about swimming if it's dangerous to you. //Relationship Sable1 -1

Response1a:: I think so too! I'm the fastest flier of all my sisters. Swimming looks a lot like flying, so I know I'd be fast.
Response1b:: It's just talk, sheesh... I won't jump in the ocean or anything, promise!

Option2a:: What do you mean, he used to be faster?
Option2b:: Do you spend a lot of time with him?

Response2a:: His legs don't work like they used to. Or maybe his knees? He told me, but I don't remember 'cause he tells me lots of things.[]I know for sure that he doesn't run very fast at all. He swims even faster than he runs, isn't that funny? Just like a fishy!
Response2b:: Sure, he tells me lots of things. I learn a lot, too. Like, his legs don't work like they used to. Or maybe it's his knees? He told me, but I don't remember 'cause he tells me lots of things.[]I know for sure that he doesn't run very fast at all. He swims even faster than he runs, isn't that funny? Just like a fishy!
