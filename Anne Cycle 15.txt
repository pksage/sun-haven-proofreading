Anne Cycle 15

Dialogue:: XX? You're... <i>gazing</i> at me. It's almost romantic, though. Almost.

Option1:: I've been thinking about our future.
Option2:: Anne, are you happy with our relationship?

Response1:: Our future? I've got a plan for my own future, XX.[]If your future plan joins with mine, then great! But I'm not changing course anytime soon.

Response2:: Whoa - that was out of the blue! What, you think I'll leave you for a business opportunity or something?[]Sure, my life is a constant race with money at the goal, but that's business. And I still want to race, you know?[]But now I have you and suddenly I find myself thinking of something other than the next big score.[]Wow... I wasn't even sure of that until I said it out loud!

Option1a:: I would expect nothing less from you, Anne.

Option1b:: I love that about you - you're as determined as a young dragon. //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: I feel like that can be taken either as an insult or a compliment, so I'll choose compliment!

Response1b:: Ooh, you said a young dragon? I like that! Maybe I should make that my shop's new insignia. 


Option2a:: Do you ever really stop thinking about money? //Relationship Anne15 -1
Option2b:: Maybe what you need is a partner in your race. //Relationship Anne15 2 Romantic


Response2a:: Nope. Never have, never will. If you ever want to have a life with me down the road, you have to consider that.

Response2b:: Aw, using my own analogy to say something sweet! Unoriginal, but sweet. I knew there was a reason I fell for you, XX.[]Maybe you're right - maybe I could use a partner like you in my race. But if you join me, it has to be for good.[]Are you getting the hint, XX? Well here's another - I could really use a new ring!
