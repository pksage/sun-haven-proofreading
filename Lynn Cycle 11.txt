Dialogue:: I never noticed how defined your features are. I love looking at your face!

Option1:: I bet I would look better in something made by you.

Option2:: Every day I see your face is a good day, Lynn. //Emote none Happy


Response1:: You mean like armor? I guess I could do that, but you'd have to put in an order with Solon and I would need your measurements.

Response2:: Come on XX, you know I hate it when you make my face turn red!


Option1a:: You can measure me here and now! //Relationship Lynn11 -1

Option1b:: Just kidding, I don't want to add to your workload. //Relationship Lynn11 2

Response1a:: You know, I'm actually really busy with other work, XX. Maybe another time.

Response1b:: Oh, XX you goose! You had me going there.[]Uh oh, am I too gullible?


Option2a:: I'm surprised I still have that effect on you. 

Option2b:: Even if you still get embarrassed, you've really come out of your shell since we met.

Response2a:: Honestly, I don't know if you ever WON'T have that effect on me. Just go easy on me, okay?

Response2b:: Thank you XX. I know I've come a long way, but I think you take a little credit for that, too.
