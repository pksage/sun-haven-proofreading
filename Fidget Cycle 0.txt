Dialogue:: Hey, you don't sound familiar. Who are you?!

Option1:: I'm XX, and I didn't say anything.

Response1:: No, not the sound of your voice! Can't you tell I'm a bat monster? I use my echo to see things. When I heard my echo off of you, I knew I hadn't heard you before.[]My name is Fidget. Maybe I'll hear you around sometime.
