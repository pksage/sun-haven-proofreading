Dialogue:: Hi, XX. You look distracted. Is there something on your mind?

Option2:: Actually, I was thinking... of asking you on a date. //Emote none Romantic


Response1:: I think I would buy a big house and start my own school. That would be a dream come true, actually.

Response2:: XX... I've been hoping you would ask me that, but now I'm afraid I'm dreaming!


Option1a:: That's not a very fun answer. //Relationship Jun5 -1 Mad

Option1b:: That's very you, Jun! //Relationship Jun5 2 Happy

Response1a:: No? Well, I'm more concerned with being helpful than fun.

Response1b:: Ah, do you already know me so well? I'm flattered!


Option2a:: Actually, Jun, I don't think this is the best time. //Emote none Sad

Option2b:: Don't be silly - this is real! What do you say? //Quest none JunHangout1Quest
