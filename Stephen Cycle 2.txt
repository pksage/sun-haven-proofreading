Response1:: You mean to tell me our Glorite operation got taken out by a farmer?[]...[]...Heheheh. That's life, isn't it?

Response2:: Eh, I don't know. The only things I've been good at are stealing and helping out Mari n' Ronald. I try to stick with what I know I'm good at.


Option1a:: I'm not JUST a farmer.

Option1b:: I'm someone of many talents.

Option2a:: Give something new a try sometime. //Relationship Stephen 1

Option2b:: You lack motivation. //Relationship Stephen -1

Response2a:: Well... I got a second chance at life, maybe that's a wake up call to, you know, 'find myself' or whatever you want to call it. Alright, I'll think about it! 

Response2b:: I'm comfortable with where I am. If that's lacking motivation, then that's how it is.
