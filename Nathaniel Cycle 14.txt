Nathaniel Cycle 14

Dialogue:: Ever since we started dating, the soldiers have been whispering and giving me funny looks. I don't get it!

Option1:: They must be curious about us.

Option2:: Are you worried this will affect your authority with them?


Response1:: Lester and Allison, maybe. But Calvin? I can't imagine he cares one bit.

Response2:: Oh, no. If anything, they will make some jokes behind my back and forget about it. I've been their captain too long for them to see me as anything else.


Option1a:: Be honest - do you like the attention?

Option1b:: Does it bother you that they talk about us?

Response1a:: I've never cared to be the center of attention, not unless I'm addressing my soldiers. But I guess there's something kind of fun about it!

Response1b:: I've never cared to be the center of attention, not unless I'm addressing my soldiers. But I guess there's something kind of fun about it!


Option2a:: The way you maintain your authority is always impressive. //Relationship Nathaniel14 2 Happy
 
Option2b:: I wouldn't be so sure. //Relationship Nathaniel14 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Heh, you think so? Well, thanks, XX.[]Somehow you always find a way to boost me up, even when I don't think I need it.

Response2b:: You don't know them like I do, XX.
