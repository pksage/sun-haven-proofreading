Option1:: You mentioned your work before. What kind of work do you do?

Option2:: What do you do when you're not working?

Response2:: I'm hardly ever not working. But when I do take a break, I'll stop in the tavern to have a meal or go for a walk. That's maybe once a day.

Option2a:: You only get out once a day?

Option2b:: What do you like to eat?

Response2a:: We can't all be farmers, XX.
