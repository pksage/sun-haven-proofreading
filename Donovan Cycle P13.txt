Donovan Cycle P13

Dialogue:: Man, I'm tired. The castle held some big royal parade after midnight the other day. Imagine, the castle guards all stomping down the streets nonstop![]My sewer was shaking the whole time, and it took forever to get to sleep!

Option1:: A military parade sounds out of place for Withergate.
Option2:: How did you finally get to sleep?

Response1:: Oh, trust me, everyone pretty much feels the same way. No one really wants to watch a big, boring parade of armored stiffs walk up and down the streets.
Response2:: I figured I'd wait it out, at first. But they never stopped. Finally I just went out into the forest and found a good log to snooze on.[]It's been a while since I slept outside, and I thought that would be as good a reason to as any.

Option1a:: What's the point of a parade? //Emote none Mad
Option1b:: Minos probably likes flaunting his power. //Emote none Mad

Response1a:: I guess it was to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty," whatever that means. It sounds like a bunch of goblin cake to me.[]Just the king flexing his power, and keeping me awake! 
Response1b:: See, that's what I said! The parade was supposed to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty," whatever that means.[]Like you said, though, it was just the king showing off his power, and keeping me awake!  

Option2a:: Desperate times call for Donovan solutions. //Relationship DonovanP13 2 Happy
Option2b:: Maybe you'd have slept better if you had an apartment. //Relationship DonovanP13 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Whoa, that's an awesome saying! Did you get that from me? I feel like I've said that before. I'm using it from now on, either way.[]Thanks for cheering me up after that obnoxious parade.
Response2b:: One night of ruined sleep versus paying rent... let me see...[]Yeah, your idea is no good, XX. I'll take my chances with the parades.
