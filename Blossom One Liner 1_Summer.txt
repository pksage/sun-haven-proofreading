Blossom Summer Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome to Blossom's Seasonal Shop! We have the cool goods to beat the summer heat! And by "we" I mean "I" - it's just me! Come take a look!

Option1:: Who are you?
Option2:: What are seasonal tokens?

Response1:: I'm a merchant! I set up my special booth in Sun Haven because of the abundance of magical energy - and people - you find here! I figured if there was anywhere I could find what I was looking for, it was here.[]I've got my own plans, but don't worry about those, hehe. If you bring me what I'm looking for, I have fabulous seasonal prizes to trade for them!
Response2:: When energy from the planet seeps out from the ground, it crystalizes. Sometimes it turns into ore... but other times it turns into <color=#39CCFF>special season tokens</color>![]The tokens will <color=#39CCFF>correspond with the season they're found in</color>,  and so will my booth![]Monsters are attracted to the tokens, so you'll <color=#39CCFF>find lots of them dropped by monsters</color>! If you ever come across some, bring them here!

Option1a:: Alright.

Option2a:: Alright.
