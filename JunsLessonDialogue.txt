Dialogue:: XX, I was hoping to bump into you. If you have a moment to spare, I could use your help with something.


Option1:: How can I help?

Option2(Permanent):: Where should I go?


Response1:: I'm planning a reward-based lesson for the kids and I need <color=#39CCFF>Cookies</color> to use as the reward. You'd be doing me a big favor if you brought me <color=#39CCFF>4 cookies</color>.

Response2:: After you have the <color=#39CCFF>Cookies</color>, you can bring them to my desk in the library.


Option2a:: Okay, I'll have your cookies in no time. //Quest none JunsLessonQuest
