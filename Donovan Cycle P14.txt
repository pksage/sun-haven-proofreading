Donovan Cycle P14

Dialogue:: Hey, I think I can smell the last meal you ate. Did you have... tree bark? Wait, no, that must be something else.

Option1:: You're probably smelling my farm, Donovan. //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2:: Why would you want to smell my last meal, anyway?

Response1:: Yeah, okay, that makes a lot of sense. I didn't take you for a tree-eater.
Response2:: People are usually impressed by that trick. Then again, I also usually get it right. Guess today's not my lucky day, huh?

Option1a:: What's a tree-eater?
Option1b:: Still, your nose is pretty impressive! //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Someone who eats trees, obviously. Not that I've ever met anyone who did...
Response1b:: Ah, thanks! I try to keep a sharp sniffer in case of emergencies. 

Option2a:: I'm sure it's really impressive when it works! //Relationship DonovanP14 2 Happy
Option2b:: That's a silly trick anyway. //Relationship DonovanP14 -1 Embarrassed

Response2a:: Heheh, yeah! Maybe I'll try again next time to really impress you. 
Response2b:: Huh, you might be right... Maybe it's time to retire that tired old trick.
