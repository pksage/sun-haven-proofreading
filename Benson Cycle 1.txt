Benson Cycle 1

Dialogue:: "If we ain't collecting honey, we ain't makin' money." That's what my grandma always says, at least.


Option1:: Who is your grandma?

Option2:: Why did you become a beekeeper?

Response1:: Shucks, her name's Edna. She's one of the two matriarchs of our whole farm.

Response2:: I loved honey when I was a kid. I figured why not join the family business? It's a lot more fun than jam making, that's for sure.


Option1a:: Why are there two matriarchs? 

Option1b:: Does your farm really need TWO matriarchs?

Response1a:: Us rabbit Amari always have big families, I guess it would be too much work for only one to handle! So we got two, yup.

Response1b:: Us rabbit Amari always have big families, I guess it would be too much work for only one to handle! So we got two, yup.


Option2a:: I love honey, too!

Option2b:: Jam making is more fun.

Response2a:: Hey, who <i>doesn't</i>  love honey? It goes great with everything! //Relationship Benson1 1

Response2b:: Yup, no thanks. Mashing and straining all that fruit is enough to turn you mad. Take Darwin, for example! //Relationship Benson1 -1
