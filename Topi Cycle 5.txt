Topi Cycle 5

Dialogue:: I want a little sister, but mom says dad is too lazy to go and get one!

Option1:: You should tell your dad to try harder!
Option2:: What would you do if you had a little sister?

Response1:: I try to, but he never listens. He just says "we'll see about it soon," but I want a sister now!
Response2:: That's easy. I'd teach her where my best hiding spots are, and how to play Dragons!

Option1a:: I'd bet you'll have a little sister before you know it. //Relationship Topi5 2
Option1b:: You shouldn't whine like that. //Relationship Topi5 -1

Response1a:: You really think so, XX? I hope it's a sister and not a brother, or Pod will get jealous!
Response1b:: You sound like my mom.

Option2a:: What if she's better at Dragons than you?
Option2b:: Where are your best hiding spots?

Response2a:: Then we'd be the best brother and sister Dragon team ever!
Response2b:: Well there's one right behind the record shop where... just kidding! I'm never telling you, XX!
