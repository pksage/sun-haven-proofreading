Anne Cycle P12

Dialogue:: I'm thinking about investing in some property around Sun Haven.

Option1:: I didn't take you for a property dealer.
Option2:: Which property were you looking at? //Emote none Happy

Response1:: Only sometimes. It's profitable, but I prefer to be able to pick up and travel with my goods.[]Until I find someone versed in magic who knows how to move land, property is a firmly fixed asset.

Response2:: The mines! Can you believe no one really owns it? Bernard at the town hall might sell me the deed of ownership. It's incredibly expensive, but just imagine![]I could charge an entry fee, a minecart fee, a charge for ore collection... so many options!

Option1a:: You should buy a farm, like me!

Option1b:: Someone that can move land? That's a wild idea! //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Hm, no thanks. You of all people should know that land meant for farming needs considerable preparation and upkeep.[]I've no interest in hiring workers to turn undeveloped land into something worth reselling. And I'm sure not doing it myself!

Response1b:: Hey, I didn't entirely mean it as a joke. If someone can dream it, then they can do it. And then I can pay them to do it for me![]If there is someone out there who can actually move land, then I'll find them, contract them, and make a fortune!


Option2a:: What would we get in return for those fees? //Relationship AnneP12 2 Happy
Option2b:: That sounds greedy. //Relationship AnneP12 -1 Mad


Response2a:: Well, for starters, did you know the entire mine is dangerously unstable? It'll need to have support beams installed, which isn't cheap.[]And the minecart tracks haven't been cleaned or repaired since being laid down years and years ago.[]There's a lot of work to be done and it won't come cheap, but I can make it happen if I'm smart about it. 

Response2b:: I might charge people to use the mines, but then I'd also be responsible for making sure it's safe - something no one is doing.[]It's a lot more than just me making a quick buck, but thanks for assuming the worst of me, XX.
