Donovan Cycle 1

Dialogue:: It's my new favorite person, XX![]Let's talk.

Option1:: You seem to know this town well. What do you do for fun around here?

Option2:: So you live here?


Response1:: I hang around the carnival a lot. I wait for people to lose the games so I can step up and win right afterwards, heheh.[]Honestly, how hard is it to count jellybeans?

Response2:: Sure, why wouldn't I? It's the city of darkness! What am I going to do, just pass up the chance to live in darkness forever? I don't think so.


Option1a:: Carnival? //Emote none Happy

Option1b:: That sounds kind of mean. //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Don't tell me you haven't been to the carnival yet! Man, you're in for a treat. The food is unhealthy and there are so many people that you can't escape the body odor! You'll love it.

Response1b:: I promise, I'm only mean when it's funny.


Option2a:: Only monsters live in darkness. //Relationship Donovan1 -1 Mad

Option2b:: Maybe I should try living in the darkness for a while. //Relationship Donovan1 2 Happy

Response2a:: Well... yeah. Look around, we're all monsters here. You might want to rethink your view on monsters. Or at least, shut up about it!

Response2b:: Really, you? I would love to see that! You could show the Human town that not everything is scary in the dark.
