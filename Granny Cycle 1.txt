Response1:: Oh, how wonderful. I wish we had more visitors here. On the other hand, perhaps that's not best for the patients.[]Well, peace and quiet is nice too!
Response2:: I help in any way I can. Lately, that means baking plenty of cookies for our hungry friend here!

Option1a:: Do you get bored here?
Option1b:: The farm gets quiet, too.

Response1a:: Certainly, sometimes. But the slow times help me appreciate the thrills of life. Remember that the next time you're twiddling your thumbs, young one!
Response1b:: That's right, you're the farmer. How lovely! You must be well-acquainted with the peace and quiet.[]I can feel it in your energy, too - such a calm, powerful spirit you have.
