Dialogue:: <i>*Yawn*</i>... Sorry, did you say something? I'm so bored I almost fell asleep. Hey listen, do me a favor? Bring me a <color=#39CCFF>Book</color> to read, would you? I can't get caught sleeping on duty again.


Option1:: Where can I find this book?

Option2(Permanent):: What kind of book do you want?


Response1:: If you chop a tree down and make paper out of it, you could make one from scratch. Or just go to the library... that's probably a better idea.[]Try not to get sidetracked, would you? The safety of all at Sun Haven is at stake, here.

Response2:: Something to keep me awake. Maybe something funny? Look for a <color=#39CCFF>Joke Book</color>, if they have one.


Option2a:: Okay, I'll get a <color=#39CCFF>Joke Book</color> for you. //Quest none CalvinIsBoredQuest

Option2b:: I can't help you right now.


Response2a:: Thanks, citizen. I'll be here. Like always. (End)

Response2b:: Figures. Hopefully I don't nod off, or I'll be scrubbing the latrine for a week. (End)
