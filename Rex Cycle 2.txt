Rex Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hello again! Spare time for a chat?


Option1:: Have you been to the caves around here?

Option2:: What do you do when you're not underground?


Response1:: Oh, of course. They're fantastic, full of useful ore and beautiful rock formations.[]I haven't had the chance to get all the way through them, but that's my first goal before I move on to the next town.

Response2:: For fun, I like to relax in whatever tavern is nearest. Taverns, pubs, watering holes - these places keep me from getting lonely on the road.


Option1a:: All the way to the bottom? Is that possible?

Option1b:: You take this really seriously!

Response1a:: Of course! I like to say, anything is possible with perseverance and rations. It helps me remember to pack enough food.

Response1b:: Of course! I can't claim to be the best miner in the world without conquering every mine. For now I just say I'm "almost" the best miner in the world, but that doesn't sound as impressive.


Option2a:: You're a nice guy. I bet you make lots of friends! //Relationship Rex2 2

Option2b:: Nobody makes real friends in a tavern. //Relationship Rex2 -1

Response2a:: That's mighty nice of you to say! Sometimes it's less about making friends and just about being around people.[]Too much time underground and sometimes I forget there's a whole world up here!

Response2b:: Maybe not with that attitude.[]Even if they're just your pal for a night, it's nice to make conversation - even with strangers.
