Quincy Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Hello again. You seem pretty busy, huh?

Option1:: It's true, I have a lot going on right now.
Option2:: Aren't you busy?

Response1:: It must be nice to have so much to do. Living around here can get dull, but I've learned to lean into the routine. Do you like being so busy?
Response2:: We tend to take our time in Nel'Vari. We don't really live by deadlines or due dates. That's why I like to do a lot of fishing. I can help the town and relax at the same time!

Option1a:: I enjoy keeping busy. //Relationship Quincy1 2
Option1b:: I don't like working, I'd rather relax. //Relationship Quincy1 -1

Response1a:: I can see that just by looking at you. Your hands are calloused pretty good!
Response1b:: It must be a struggle to keep your farm, then. I guess that speaks to your character, huh?

Option2a:: Productivity and relaxation? That's smart!
Option2b:: You must be a great fisher, then.

Response2a:: Do you think so? It's just the norm for me!
Response2b:: I usually come away with a few fish. It's easy here, though.[]Hey, you should fish Nel'Vari's waters! If you haven't already, I'm sure you'll catch something new.
