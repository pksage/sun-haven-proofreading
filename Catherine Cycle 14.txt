Catherine Cycle 14

Dialogue:: Don't you feel Sun Haven picking up speed? It almost feels like it did ten years ago!

Option1:: Do you think Sun Haven is actually going to bounce back?

Option2:: Do you think you'll miss the peace and quiet? //Emote none Happy


Response1:: I've always had faith in our little home, you know that. Maybe I'm reading into some misleading energies, but I really think Sun Haven turned a corner recently.

Response2:: Maybe, but there will always be a quiet corner of Sun Haven. That's part of why I love it here. No matter who you are, there's a place for you here.


Option1a:: I think I've noticed the same thing. Sun Haven is coming back! //Relationship Catherine14 2 Happy

Option1b:: One day I hope to be as optimistic as you. //Relationship Catherine14 -1

Response1a:: I'm so excited for you to see the town in its prime! Oh, and the tavern is so fun when it's full of strange travelers. XX, I'm glad you're here for this.

Response1b:: It's not optimism, XX. Optimism has no basis. I'm going off of things I see and feel. There's a big difference.


Option2a:: I know I've got a place here... with you!

Option2b:: I'm just glad we can stop worrying so much for the town's future.

Response2a:: Oh, extra cheesy today? Mm, I love that kind of cheese!

Response2b:: Maybe, but let's not declare victory just yet. We shouldn't slow down before we're there, you know?[]XX, let's keep working to make Sun Haven the best it can be!
