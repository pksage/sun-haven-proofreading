Jun Cycle 6

Dialogue:: I love seeing you around town, XX. You make Sun Haven a little more perfect!

Option1:: I feel like I could tell you anything, Jun.

Option2:: What does a perfect day look like for you?


Response1:: I cherish the ability to gain someone's trust. People confide in me because I'm good at keeping secrets - really good. You can trust me more than anyone, XX.

Response2:: Hm, good question. I'd most likely paint in the morning and walk around town in the afternoon. I enjoy seeing the people that I know just living their lives.[]Then in the evening, I would watch the sunset from my house with a nice, hearty salad.


Option1a:: You had my trust a long time ago. //Relationship Jun6 2 Happy

Option1b:: On second thought, I'm not so sure. //Relationship Jun6 -1 Sad

Response1a:: To hear you say that... Well, the feeling is mutual. I don't have as many people to confide in as I have confiding in me, so I'm grateful to have you, XX.

Response1b:: I understand. Take your time, XX.


Option2a:: Everything about that screams "Jun." //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: I can't think of a more perfect day. //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: Oh, I forgot something important! The day wouldn't be perfect without you in it, XX.

Response2b:: Oh, I forgot something important! The day wouldn't be perfect without you in it, XX.
