Raimi Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Ever since this Withergate thing cropped up, I've had eyes on the back of my head.[]Er, but that's just a saying. I only have the two eyes up front, obviously.


Option1:: What do you think of the Withergate rumors?

Option2:: So what made you become a hunter?


Response1:: They're not just rumors, I've seen the monster city myself. Yeah, huge fiery towers and flying monsters everywhere. We need to be prepared, because a fight is coming.

Response2:: I guess I started as a teenager. Both my folks had bad joints from working the mines their whole lives, so they couldn't spend long days walking in the forest.[]It was up to me to provide when money was tight, so I taught myself how to track and hunt. I got so good at it, I started teaching lessons to bring in some money on the side.


Option1a:: Has anyone else seen it?

Option1b:: Where did you see it?

Response1a:: No, I was alone. Well, I had my friend with me but he was knocked unconscious by a golem. I barely got us out of there alive!

Response1b:: I can't be sure because it was so dark. I wandered alone for two days before I found the road back to Sun Haven.


Option2a:: Your parents were lucky to have you. //Relationship Raimi2 2

Option2b:: You've never had any professional lessons? //Relationship Raimi2 -1 

Response2a:: Thanks farmer. Not to get a big head about it, but I'm real proud of being a provider! It feels good to give back.

Response2b:: You're not hearing me, farmer - I <i>am</i> the professional in this situation.
