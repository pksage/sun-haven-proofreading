Nathaniel Cycle 8

Dialogue:: Is it just me, or does Sun Haven feel like a different town than it did a few weeks ago?[]I guess you never can know what the future holds.

Option1:: So then, what's the next step for your future?

Option2:: Nathaniel, What's your proudest moment?


Response1:: You mean after the service? Hm, I don't really know.[]Maybe I really could try to be a sailor.

Response2:: My proudest moment? Hm... out of all my time in the military, one day stands out.[]It was very early in my career. Walking home one night, I heard a lady scream about a monster, so I ran to assist. I put myself between her and the monster and drew my sword.[]The monster turned out to be a raccoon eating a really big fish, but I was still proud of my response! That's when I knew I had the instincts of a real soldier.


Option1a:: That's a great idea! //Relationship Nathaniel8 2 Embarrassed

Option1b:: You really think you could? //Relationship Nathaniel8 -1 Sad

Response1a:: Heh, nobody's ever supported a dream of mine that wasn't about the military. In fact, I don't know if I've <i>had</i>  a dream that wasn't about the military. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1b:: If my military time has taught me anything, it's that I can do anything I set my mind to - even if not everyone thinks so.


Option2a:: That's a pretty heroic story... I guess.

Option2b:: Monster or not, you sprung into action! //Relationship Nathaniel8 2 Happy

Response2a:: It was an important moment for me, so I don't even care what anyone else thinks about it.

Response2b:: Exactly! Most people just laugh at that story, but you see things the same way I do.
