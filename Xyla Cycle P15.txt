Dialogue:: You know, I think it's ridiculous that you got the apartment right next to mine.

Option1:: Why is that ridiculous? //Emote none Mad
Option2:: I didn't ask for that exact apartment.

Response1:: Because the top floor is <i>supposed</i> to be for high-profile tenants only. I'm part of the royal council, so it makes sense that I'm there.[]But you? You were just the only person looking for a room!
Response2:: Sure, sure, pass the blame. Classy move. You better stay nice and quiet, got it? I don't need any trouble from next door.

Option1a:: So go complain about it. //Relationship XylaP15 -1 Mad
Option1b:: Feel free to sleep on the roof, then! //Relationship XylaP15 2

Response1a:: You need to check your attitude, sewer rat. Besides, Flemmett doesn't take complaints.
Response1b:: Oh, I see how it is! You think you've earned that apartment, huh? Well then, I vow to be the <i>worst</i> next door neighbor possible. Just for you!

Option2a:: I won't give you any trouble. //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: Well, now I kind of want to give you some trouble... //Emote none Mad

Response2a:: Good! Because I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
Response2b:: Trust me, XX, that's not what you want. I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
