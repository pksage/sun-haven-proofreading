Stephen Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Oh- heh... It's you...[]<i>Stephen coughs nervously, not able to find his words for a moment.</i>[]Er... say, I never did have a moment to say this, but... thanks for the second chance you gave me back there.

Option1:: You're welcome for the second chance.

Option2:: Why turn to crime in the first place?


Response1:: I promise that my days of poaching are behind me! I didn't mean to harm anyone, especially not any animals or anything like that. It's relieving to be living on the right side of the law!

Response2:: I want to say that I was a poor young boy who didn't have any choice... but that isn't entirely honest. I have a lot to reflect on now that I've gotten this second chance.


Option1a:: You better be on your best behavior from now on. //Relationship Stephen -1

Option1b:: We all make mistakes in life. //Relationship Stephen 1

Response1a:: ...Right.[]<i>Stephen coughs into his hand, a look of shame on his face.</i>

Response1b:: Boy am I glad you're the forgiving type. I won't let it go to waste, that's a promise!


Option2a:: Welcome to the right side of the law. 

Option2b:: I hope you learn that honesty pays.

Response2a:: Heheh. I've got you to thank for that, don't I? Who knew old Stephen would get a second chance.

Response2b:: Heheh. I've got you to thank for the opportunity, don't I? Who knew old Stephen would get a second chance.
