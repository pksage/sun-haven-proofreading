Anne Cycle 4

Dialogue:: XX, good to see you! Do you need any help managing your finances? I have some great tips!


Option1:: Since you know so much, why not just buy a shop in town?

Option2:: I know you've traveled a lot for work. How many cities have you lived in?


Response1:: My mobility is a key part of my success. To put it simply, I find my way out when the gold stops coming in. That's how I've survived this long.[]It's a lot harder to leave if my shop isn't on wheels!

Response2:: Oh jeez... I've visited too many to count but I only actually lived in about ten of them. A couple here in the Western Region, five in the Eastern Region, and three in the north.


Option1a:: Maybe if you put your effort into a store, customers would travel to you. //Relationship Anne4 -1 Mad

Option1b:: You've got some good survival instincts!  //Relationship Anne4 2


Response1a:: I put plenty of effort into my shop already, XX. Besides, a farmer is the last person I would take business advice from.

Response1b:: Of course I do! Whoops, I mean... thanks! Survival was the first thing I learned. The second was business.


Option2a:: You've never lived in the south?

Option2b:: You spent a lot of time in the east, huh? //Emote none Happy


Response2a:: One day I will, but only after I'm done with my merchant cart. Getting it to the islands in the south is a real pain - it doesn't float and transportation costs more than it's worth.

Response2b:: Easterners treated me very kindly. Plus, they have very loose pockets, if you know what I mean! They can be a little traditional for my taste, but everyone is welcoming no matter where you go.[]Not to mention the food. The servings they give are huge!
