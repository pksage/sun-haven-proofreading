Lucia Cycle 13

Dialogue:: You make Sun Haven feel more like home than ever before. I didn't think that was a possibility!

Option1:: Do you think people will talk about you marrying a farmer?

Option2:: You seem more relaxed these days.


Response1:: I should think not. Regardless, it doesn't matter one bit - people can talk all they want, but their words don't have to mean a thing to us.

Response2:: I'm sure I know why that is - don't act coy, clearly I'm talking about you, XX![]I have more balance between work and my personal life than I ever have before. I'm surprised at how much of a relief I feel, to be honest.


Option1a:: I don't know, I wouldn't want to hurt your career. //Relationship Lucia13 -1 Mad

Option1b:: You're right, it's none of their business. //Relationship Lucia13 2

Response1a:: My career is mine alone to worry about. Focus on your own problems, XX.

Response1b:: I would prefer to worry about ourselves and forget about others when we're together.


Option2a:: You're not worried that you're working less because of me?  //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: It's delightful to see you smiling so much. //Emote none Romantic

Response2a:: Not one bit! Even if I am working slightly less, it actually feels like I'm thinking more clearly. I would even say I'm getting more work done than I was before.

Response2b:: XX, for that I have you to thank. My inner fire is burning brighter than ever with your love.
