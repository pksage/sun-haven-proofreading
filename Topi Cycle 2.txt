Topi Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hi XX. I'm going to play Dragons with Pod!


Option1:: Your parents trust you to play without them watching?

Option2:: How do you play?


Response1:: I guess so. Anyway, Dad usually works on his sculptures outside so he can see me and Pod playing.

Response2:: First you have to make a dragon - mine is an ice dragon so you can't choose that one. Then, you have a dragon battle!


Option1a:: You must be very responsible for your age. //Relationship Topi1 -1

Option1b:: Is your dad good at watching you? //Relationship Topi1 2

Response1a:: I guess so. I don't know.

Response1b:: I guess so. I don't know.


Option2a:: I'll choose... lightning dragon! //Relationship Topi2 2

Option2b:: I'll choose... fire dragon! //Relationship Topi2 -1

Response2a:: Whoa, cool! Nobody's ever played lightning dragon before!

Response2b:: No fair, you just chose that because I chose ice. You play just like Pod!
