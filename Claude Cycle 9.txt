Dialogue:: Oh![]Sorry XX, I didn't see you there. I'm glad it's just you and not anyone else. 

Option1:: Is there anyone in Sun Haven you like to spend time with?

Option2:: Claude... you're not dating anyone, right? //Emote none Embarrassed


Response1:: Aside from you, the answer's no. Some people are a bit more tolerable, I guess. But I don't think that's what you mean.

Response2:: Huh? Why, um, do you assume that?[]Eh... forget it. Of course I'm not.


Option1a:: I'm glad you have somebody, even if it's just me. //Relationship Claude9 2 Happy

Option1b:: It's unhealthy for you to be so antisocial. //Relationship Claude9 -1

Response1a:: "Just you" is more than enough for me, XX.

Response1b:: Calling me out on how antisocial I am doesn't exactly put me in the mood for making friends, XX.


Option2a:: I was just wondering. //Emote none Sad

Option2b:: Will you go out with me? //Quest none ClaudeHangout1Quest

Response2a:: Okay...

Response2b:: Oh... Are you sure? I don't want you to feel obligated. If you don't change your mind, meet me in front of my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
