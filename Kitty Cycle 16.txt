Kitty Cycle 16

Dialogue:: Hey XX, do you know what I am? I'm the happiest Kitty alive!

Option1:: What has you so happy? //Emote none Happy
Option2:: Is this really the happiest you've ever been?

Response1:: Don't act like you don't know! You're just teasing Kitty, nya!
Response2:: Hm, I think so. The only other time I can think of is when I was in the circus. Kitty slipped off her rope and fell very very far to the ground, nyan.[]I thought everyone would be disappointed, but they all cheered for me when I landed on my feet!

Option1a:: I'm only joking, Kitty!  //Emote none Romantic
Option1b:: You think it's fun, too!  //Emote none Romantic

Response1a:: Teehee, I know that! XX is very silly, but very fun too. It's why I love you!
Response1b:: Teehee, I know that! XX is very silly, but very fun too. It's why I love you!

Option2a:: A mistake is nothing to be happy about. //Relationship Kitty16 -1
Option2b:: That's amazing, Kitty! //Relationship Kitty16 2 Happy

Response2a:: Mm, I disagree! Turning a mistake into a happy moment is a great thing, nya! Maybe you just don't understand?
Response2b:: Because Kitty wasn't hurt? It's normal for me! I fall all the time and haven't been hurt, not once, nya!
