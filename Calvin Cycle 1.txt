Calvin Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Oh, you again. Welcome to the party.


Option1:: You say that like it's not a party.

Option2:: Why did you choose to become a soldier?


Response1:: Yeah, that's on purpose. There's no party here.

Response2:: It was my last option. I dropped out of my apprenticeship and didn't feel like delivering baby griffons for a living like my parents. So, here I am. Soldier boy.


Option1a:: You should just leave if you hate it here. //Relationship Calvin1 -1

Option1b:: You're a breath of fresh air. //Relationship Calvin1 1

Response1a:: Listen, I don't hate it here. I don't love it either. I'm just bored.

Response1b:: Hah, good one. 


Option2a:: Well this isn't so bad compared to that, huh?

Option2b:: So you don't have any personal interest in being a soldier?

Response2a:: You're not wrong, but that's a low bar.

Response2b:: Not a bit. But it pays well and I get free food, so it's good enough for me.
