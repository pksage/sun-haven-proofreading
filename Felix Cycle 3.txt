Felix Cycle 3

Dialogue:: You seem to be getting along well these days, XX.

Option1:: I think I'm starting to fit into Withergate.
Option2:: Where do you live in Withergate?

Response1:: Despite its rough exterior, Withergate really is a very inclusive place. It was a city made by outcasts, to be lived in by outcasts.
Response2:: Felicity and I live in an apartment. It's not much, but it's comfortable... and large enough for the both of us.

Option1a:: Outcasts?
Option1b:: Demons are outcasts?

Response1a:: Monsterfolk were outcasts from everywhere. As for Demons, well, our race has a very deep history. You should read a book about it sometime.

Option2a:: Oh, I live in the apartments, too!
Option2b:: Oh yeah, the apartment building! Which apartment is yours?

Response2a:: Oh... I didn't mean Flemmett's apartment building. We live in an apartment above a night club. It's got all the space we need.[]...Sorry, they're not the type of apartments I could really recommend for you. They're, uh, all occupied. Sorry.
