Ettie Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Back to visit again, darlin'?


Option1:: How long have you lived here?

Option2:: Tell me about your orchard.

Response1:: Why, I've lived here my whole life! So has my sister, Edna. We were born and raised here, and after that we did some raising of our own.

Response2:: Interested in our history, darlin'? I'm afraid there's not a whole lot to tell. This orchard was started by our great grandmother Aloysia Hare. Just like our family, it's grown mighty big through the generations.


Option1a:: That's really impressive.

Option1b:: That's really sweet.

Response1a:: Thank you for saying so, darlin'. But to us it's just normal. Nothing impressive to see here! Just hard-workin' Amari.

Response1b:: Thank you for saying so, darlin'. Family means a lot to us Amari. I'll always count my lucky stars for each one of them.  


Option2a:: What incredible family history.

Option2b:: This orchard must make a lot of money.

Response2a:: Aw, thank you, darlin'. That means a lot to this old orchard girl. //Relationship Ettie1 1

Response2b:: It's not about the money, darlin'. This orchard's real value is in the family who works it. //Relationship Ettie1 -1
