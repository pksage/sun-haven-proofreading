Xyla Cycle 13

Dialogue:: You got a thought bouncing around up there? Or did you just forget how to blink?

Option1:: I was just looking at the trees. Why are all the trees around here dead, anyway?

Option2:: Have you been busy around here?


Response1:: Sorry XX, there are some things you'll have to ask the king himself. That question is one of them.

Response2:: Not too busy. Withergate basically runs itself these days. Sure, I still sit on the council, but it's not nearly as busy as when I oversaw the city's construction.[]Back then, I felt like a real boss! Now I just help the king with boring jobs.


Option1a:: Why?

Option1b:: So you don't know the answer either.

Response1a:: I'm just not authorized to talk about it. I don't usually follow other people's rules, but King Minos is just about the only person in this town I defer to. So go ask the king if you want to know.

Response1b:: I'm just not authorized to talk about it. I don't usually follow other people's rules, but King Minos is just about the only person in this town I defer to. So go ask the king if you want to know.


Option2a:: You should feel honored to work with the king. //Relationship Xyla13 -1 Mad

Option2b:: If you're bored, I guess that means you're good at your job. //Relationship Xyla13 2 Happy

Response2a:: Have you been talking to Darius? That sounded just like one of his lines. Which I don't buy for a second, by the way.

Response2b:: Hm, good point. I suppose there are worse things than that. Thanks XX, that was actually helpful.
