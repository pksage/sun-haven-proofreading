Felix Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hello again, XX.

Option1:: Have you lived in Withergate for long?
Option2:: Where else in the world have you seen?

Response1:: All my life. My grandfather was actually a part of the previous Demon King, Aster's, royal guard. So I have a little bit of royalty in my blood. Or at least royalty-adjacent.
Response2:: I've traveled a lot around the Western Region. Some in the Eastern Region. Once or twice I've been up to the Northern Region. I've never had any business in the Southern Islands yet.

Option1a:: You would fit in with Darius.
Option1b:: Wow, you must really respect your grandfather.

Response1a:: Not a chance. For lack of a better term, I think Darius is a jerk. He throws his weight around like a 'proper' Demon. I'm not one for bluster like that.
Response1b:: Hm, I suppose I do. I never got a chance to meet him, as he died in battle before I was born. It's not a sensitive topic for me, I'm only saying.

Option2a:: Business?
Option2b:: What takes you all over the place like that?

Response2a:: Oh. Nothing. I do deliveries, that's all.
Response2b:: Nothing, really. Just some work. I do... deliveries. Plus, I like the see the world. It's how I met Felicity, after all.
