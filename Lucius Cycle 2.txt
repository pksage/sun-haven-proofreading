Lucius Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hello again, XX! I didn't see you for a second.

Option1:: You look deep in thought.
Option2:: So... You and Opal work together?

Response1:: So I am, XX. I was reflecting on some things. I'm used to being able to think for long stretches of time without being bothered. I apologize if it seemed like I was ignoring you.
Response2:: Ah, yes. Opal is another attendent to the moon. We do work together, though we tend to work in silence. I think I've spoken to Opal... eh, maybe three times? She's a nice girl. I love our chats.

Option1a:: Why are you used to something like that?
Option1b:: You didn't come off as rude. Just... a deep thinker.

Response1a:: Well, as I told you before, I work as an attendant to the moon. This means I'm active mostly at night, when everyone else is asleep. It's serene, but a touch lonely. Plenty of time to think, though![]Plus, even in the daytime, not many people tend to approach me. We both live in the same Nel'Vari, but sometimes I feel like people treat me as if I'm from another world...

Option2a:: Working in silence sounds peaceful.
Option2b:: Working in total silence sounds boring.

Response2a:: It is, yes. Very much so. It gives me lots of time to think to myself. Self-reflection is beautiful and important. Plus, making up arguments with myself, which is also always fun.
Response2b:: Now, mind you that I didn't say we work in total silence. There is so much to hear and see in the Nel'Varian night. I hoped you would have understood that, XX.
