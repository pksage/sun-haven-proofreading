Response1:: Oh, these! Yeah let me explain, see... well, they're a gift. Um, for you.[]I know used oven mitts aren't the best gift ever, but I've used these mitts for years.[]They've been with me through all the chaos of moving here, taking care of my sisters, and running the bakery.

Response2:: Oh wow, I don't know, I mean... I guess it depends.[]Er, sorry. You caught me off guard. Go ahead and ask again.

Response2b:: That's how you feel? Don't take this the wrong way, but that's a bit of a relief.[]Not that dating you would be a bad thing! I just have a lot going on right now.
