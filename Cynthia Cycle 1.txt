Option1:: So what made you choose to sell this stuff?

Option2:: You help people find their partners?


Response1:: I was always the matchmaker in my hometown, so I thought I'd take my talents on the road. Who knows how many families I've started along the way?

Option2b:: I'll take any help I can get!

Response2a:: Don't sound so down - finding love is what life is all about!
