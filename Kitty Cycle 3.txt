Dialogue:: In my whole life here, I've never seen the town so very very quiet as this last year.

Option1:: Are you worried about the rumors going around?

Option2:: What was it like growing up here?

Response1b:: Nya!! Thank you, XX! You're such a brave friend!


Option2a:: Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you, Kitty. //Relationship Kitty3 2 Happy
