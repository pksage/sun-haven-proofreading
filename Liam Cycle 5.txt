Liam Cycle 5

Dialogue:: I've been taking more walks like you said and it really helps. I'm more relaxed at home, which is a lot better for the girls.

Option1:: How are your sisters doing?

Option2:: Say, where is the rest of your family? //Emote none Sad


Response1:: They're just fine, thanks! Both of them are responsible for their age, so I can leave them alone sometimes.[]If they needed a close eye on them like Pod does, then I don't know how I could do my job.

Response2:: Ooh, sorry XX that's... a touchy subject. Um. Maybe I'll tell you sometime, but I don't want to get into it right now.


Option1a:: Are you sure you're giving them enough attention? //Relationship Liam5 -1 Sad

Option1b:: You've got some wonderful sisters, there. //Relationship Liam5 2 Happy

Response1a:: Hm, I guess they might be a little overlooked sometimes. You don't think I'm being neglectful? Ah, maybe I should talk to them.

Response1b:: I know. Sometimes I forget that they're so young because they manage themselves so well. I could learn something from them, for sure.


Option2a:: You can share with me.

Option2b:: I can wait until you're ready to talk about it.  //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: Sorry, XX. Maybe someday.

Response2b:: You're a good friend, XX. I'm glad you're here.
