Scott Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Good day, adventurer. Find yourself wanting for protection? One look in my cart can solve that.


Option1:: Can I ask you about your eye?

Option2:: Do you ever sell your weapons to the army?


Response1:: Go on, kid, just ask your question.

Response2:: The army? My weaponry would be wasted on their training dummies. The blades would dull long before they saw combat.[]My goods should be used by real fighters, not pansies running routines.


Option1a:: How did you lose it?

Option1b:: Actually, I feel like I'm being rude now...

Response1a:: When I was younger than you are now, I went looking in a crystal ball to see my future.[]Well, the ball turned out to be cursed. Held me captive and glowed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye. So there you go.[]I can tell you more about it another time. I've got lots to tell, you know. If you have a spot of free time, why don't you come by for a tale?

Response1b:: I figured you wouldn't have the guts to ask. I'm having a good day, so I'll tell you anyway.[]When I was younger than you are now, I went looking in a crystal ball to see my future.[]Well, the ball turned out to be cursed, and flashed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye.[]I can tell you more about it another time. I've got lots to tell, you know. If you have a spot of free time, why don't you come by for a tale?


Option2a:: You're right, soldiers really don't know what they're doing. //Relationship Scott1 2

Option2b:: Soldiers are real fighters. //Relationship Scott1 -1

Response2a:: Truer words have never been spoken.

Response2b:: Soldiers fight because they're told to. A warrior fights because the fight is in their blood. Not that you'd know anything about that.
