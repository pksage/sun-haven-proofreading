Roza Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Hey, farmer. You're looking a little ragged. You must be working hard already.


Option1:: How do you keep from burning yourself out?

Option2:: Who works the hardest between the soldiers?


Response1:: I get adequate sleep and I eat right. The occasional cold shower clears my head when I'm feeling groggy, too.

Response2:: If we're excluding me - which I assume we are - then I'd actually say it's Sophie.[]That girl has a fire inside her I haven't seen before. To be candid, I think she's trying to compete with me!


Option1a:: ... That's it?

Option1b:: Good advice, thanks!

Response1a:: I see, you were hoping for a quick-fix, some kind of trick. Go talk to Lucia or Catherine if that's what you're after. I don't work magic.

Response1b:: I'm happy to help any way I can. That's the job, after all.


Option2a:: That's a good soldier! //Relationship Roza2 2

Option2b:: You won't let her overtake you, right?  //Relationship Roza2 -1

Response2a:: Darn right that is! She's quickly becoming my favorite. Maybe I'll even take little Sophie under my wing.

Response2b:: If she works hard enough to surpass me, then she's earned it. We reward good effort in the Sun Haven Corps.[]... Not that she really stands a chance, anyway.
