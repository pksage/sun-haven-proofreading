Kara Cycle 2

Dialogue:: XX, wonderful seeing you. I hope the farm is doing well. 


Option1:: Do you work, Kara?

Option2:: What do you do for fun?


Response1:: Yes, but my work can all be done from home. Thank goodness for that.[]You must be wondering what I do. I write speeches for leaders across the world. Dignitaries, ambassadors, even a king or two.

Response2:: I like to watch Topi and Pod running around the yard, or sometimes I'll dive into a new book. I'd really like to learn a craft, though.


Option1a:: Sitting around writing all day sounds unhealthy. //Relationship Kara2 -1 

Option1b:: Kings?? You must be a great writer! //Relationship Kara2 2

Response1a:: What a negative thing to focus on. Not that you need to know, but I take fine care of myself.

Response1b:: I should hope so![]All I do is wait for another job to come in the mail, write the speech, and send it back. My payment comes a few days later. It's the best job for me, in my situation.


Option2a:: What kind of craft? 

Option2b:: What's stopping you?

Response2a:: Something with my hands, like pottery. Giuseppe has offered to get me some clay, but I don't want to be a bother to him. 

Response2b:: Oh, I'm not sure. I just haven't taken the leap yet. Who knows, maybe today is the day that inspiration takes me.[]Maybe... leatherwork? Or, needlepoint? There are so many possibilities!
