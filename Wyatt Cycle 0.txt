Dialogue:: What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen a mighty dragon before?[]Okay, maybe I'm not a guardian like the Moon Dragon... but I can still breathe fire! A little.

Option1:: My name is XX. I didn't mean to stare.

Response1:: Ehh, it's fine. My name is Wyatt. I can't really get mad at you for looking. I <i>am</i> an impressive dragon, after all!
