Response:: <i>You stand on your head. You get slime on your head. This was a bad idea.</i>

Response:: <i>Ooooh, haunted slime conjured by spirits not of this earthly realm. How scaaary... yeah, right. You grab a hankie and wipe off the slime. Ever onward.</i>

Response:: <i>You give the machine a good, long dose of the dreaded 'stink eye'. Meanwhile, slime pools around your ankles. You don't think the stink eye treatment worked.</i>

Option:: Sigh loudly.

Option:: Tickle the machine.


Response:: <i>With a grip to rival the greatest of Guardian Dragons you heft the machine up off the ground a good inch or two. You then let it fall back down. All the potions inside conveniently rearrange themselves back to normal!</i>

Response:: <i>You loudly sigh. It accomplishes nothing, so you give it another try. Still nothing. Sigh.</i>

Response:: <i>You tickle the machine. It laughs, and all the potions rearrange! But they're still in the wrong order!</i>

Option:: //HEALTH2 Punch the machine. //RIGHTANSWER


Response:: <i>In your deepest and most booming voice, you command the machine to obey your will. The machine, unphased by your acting ability, refuses to comply.</i>

Response:: <i>You spend a few moments living inside of a fantasy land in your head, where the machine works perfectly. It didn't change reality, however, and your potion is still stuck!</i>

Response:: <i>Stupid machine! You give it a solid punch. Your fingers hurt, but your potion is dislodged!</i>
