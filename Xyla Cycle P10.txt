Dialogue:: So you seem to be pretty good at earning tickets. Don't get an ego, you're just a bit less lazy than the average Withergate citizen!

Option1:: Why does Withergate use tickets, anyways?
Option2:: I worked hard for my tickets.

Response1:: They're wonderful, right? So much easier to use than those gaudy gold coins the Humans love so much. Plus, they're perfect for our carnival![]Needless to say, I was the one who pitched the ticket idea to King Minos. I truly am the best!
Response2:: Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you're very proud of all your 'hard' work, farmer. Do you have any idea how hard I work?[]One day in my shoes, and you'd be begging for your little farm back!

Option1a:: Paper money is a very novel idea. //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: Your idea seems to work for Withergate. //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Looks like you're finally starting to get it. Sometimes you gotta think outside of the box to solve a problem, and no one does that better than me!
Response1b:: Looks like you're finally starting to get it. Sometimes you gotta think outside of the box to solve a problem, and no one does that better than me!

Option2a:: I work way harder than you. //Relationship XylaP10 -1 Mad
Option2b:: Well you wouldn't last one <i>hour</i> on a farm. //Relationship XylaP10 2 Happy

Response2a:: Oh yeah? Name the first three things I do when I wake up every morning. What's that? You don't know what they are? Typical. Keep walking, outsider!
Response2b:: Ohh, big talk is my favorite kinda talk, XX. You aren't half-bad, for a stinky outsider.
