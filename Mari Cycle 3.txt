Mari Cycle 3

Dialogue:: Look here, my newest favorite customer. Take a seat, XX.[]I want you to think of this place as your home away from home. 


Option1:: You're so hospitable Mari, I can't imagine anyone giving you trouble.

Option2:: Is it difficult running the inn upstairs?


Response1:: You'd be surprised then. There's always some troublemakers comin' through with the season.

Response2:: The only difficulty is when squatters don't want to leave. I guess I can't blame 'em though. Our beds are mighty comfy!


Option1a:: Thank goodness they're only seasonal! //Relationship Mari3 2

Option1b:: You just point them out to me, and I'll take care of them. //Relationship Mari3 -1

Response1a:: Hah, seasonal! Yep, I guess that's right. All the good eggs stay right here in Sun Haven.

Response1b:: I've been doin' that job for twenty years now. Believe you me, I can handle it.


Option2a:: How do you get them out?

Option2b:: Does that happen a lot?

Response2a:: One time we had to smoke 'em out of the room they were in. Usually we just use the keys, though.

Response2b:: Not a lot, but maybe once or twice a year. Only during the busy season, though. Which lately, there hasn't been much of any busy season.
