Dialogue:: XX, I have a favor to ask you. I'd like to test a theory I read about. If all goes well, it could end up helping everyone in Sun Haven! Can you lend me a hand?


Option1:: What's the theory?

Option2(Permanent):: What do you need me to do?


Response1:: I read an article about how bright colors can help raise people's moods subconsciously. Just by being around brighter colors, several test subjects were seen to have improved moods over time.

Response2:: I'd like you to take these flowers and plant them in specific places all around town. That way, everyone will see them and hopefully get a little happier over time.


Option2a:: I'd love to help test the theory! //Quest none JunBeautificationQuest

Option2b:: I'm too busy to help you.


Response2a:: That's great! Take these four flower plants. Please plant them around town and find me when you're done! (End)

Response2b:: I see. That's okay, I understand. If you happen to find yourself with some free time, come find me. (End)

End
