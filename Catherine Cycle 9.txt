Catherine Cycle 9

Dialogue:: It feels like seeing you has become part of my routine, like pruning my plants.

Option1:: It must be a lot of work caring for all those plants.

Option2:: I can't stop thinking about you. Let's go out on a date! //Emote none Embarrassed


Response1:: Of course, but I love them! Plants are sensitive and reactive - just like people.[]I don't know, I guess sometimes I feel more connected to plants than people. That must sound weird...

Response2:: Oh! XX, you're such a sweetheart. I'm flattered that you're thinking about me!


Option1a:: You're right, that's weird. //Relationship Catherine9 -1 Sad

Option1b:: Not at all, there's a lot we can learn from plants. //Relationship Catherine9 2 Happy


Response1a:: See, this is why I prefer plants.

Response1b:: Exactly! I'm glad you agree. It makes me feel like less of an oddball.


Option2a:: Actually, I'm starting to think we should just be friends.

Option2b:: So what do you say? //Quest none CatherineHangout2Quest


Response2a:: Is that so? Well jeez, XX, that's pretty disappointing. But I'm glad that we still get to be friends.

Response2b:: Yes, absolutely, XX. Come by my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I can't wait!
