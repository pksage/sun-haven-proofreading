Dialogue:: Hello, farmer! I hope your crops are, um, growing.


Option1:: I'm surprised you've stayed open through these hard times.

Option2:: What made you want to open a record store?


Response1:: Well, what can I say? I'm careful with my money. It helps that the people of Sun Haven really appreciate their music, too.[]Matter of fact, Claude may have single-handedly kept me in business over the years.

Response2:: I know, it's not the safest bet. I'd probably be better off opening something like...[]Aw jeez, I can't even think of another shop to open! That's just it - music is the only thing that I actually know well enough to turn it into a business.


Option1a:: It sounds like you owe Claude big time. 

Option1b:: I definitely appreciate music, too! 

Response1a:: Yeah, maybe I should thank him somehow. A record on the house, I guess? What do you get somebody who's rich, anyway?

Response1b:: Well great! Grab yourself a jukebox and some records, and you'll be ready to jam out![]Is that what people say now? "Jam out?" I should really know these things.


Option2a:: It's smart to turn your interest into a career. //Relationship Arvel1 2

Option2b:: There's nothing else you're good at? //Relationship Arvel1 -1

Response2a:: Hey, thanks! I'm sure that if I tried farming like you, I'd only end up hurting myself. So you bet I'm grateful to be here!

Response2b:: Well... Man, you put me on the spot and my mind is drawing blanks.
