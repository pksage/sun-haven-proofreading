Lynn Cycle 10

Dialogue:: Hi... sweetie! I had some free time today and spent it in the library. It was so nice and quiet.

Option1:: Oh, are we using pet names, "sweetie?"

Option2:: What books do you like to read?


Response1:: We don't have to! I think it's cute, is all. I'll stop if you think it's dumb.

Response2:: These days all I have time for is texts on metallurgical techniques. Sorry, I mean books on smithing. But before I was an apprentice, I could lose myself in a good mystery novel.


Option1a:: Yeah, I'd rather not do that. //Relationship Lynn10 -1 Embarrassed

Option1b:: It is cute... pumpkin! //Relationship Lynn10 2 Happy

Response1a:: Oh, okay. I guess I'll just stick with XX.

Response1b:: Oh, good! I wasn't sure what you'd think. Like usual, we're on the same page. Everything is easy with you, XX.


Option2a:: Why do you like mystery novels?

Option2b:: Mysteries are fun - I love the big reveals at the end.

Response2a:: I love the sidekicks. A sidekick always saves the main character's life at some point. Without the strong little sidekicks, the mysteries would never get solved.

Response2b:: I love the sidekicks. A sidekick always saves the main character's life at some point. Without the strong little sidekicks, the mysteries would never get solved.
