Dialogue:: I love the carnival, but sometimes it feels like these carnival games are rigged... Really, I should win by default.

Option1:: Why should you win? //Emote none Mad

Option2:: Hey, the carnival was your doing.


Response1:: Because it's <i>my</i> carnival! Without me, there wouldn't be any prizes to win in the first place. And now I can't even win one.[]Well, forget it, I don't need any of those dumb plushies anyway.

Response2:: Exactly! That's why it's so stupid that I can't win the darn games. I've seen Donovan walk out of the carnival grounds with his arms full of toys. What's he doing that I'm not??


Option1a:: Just be better at the games! //Relationship Xyla17 2 Happy

Option1b:: I'll win one for you. //Relationship Xyla17 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Heh, of course! It's so simple![]Thanks for showing me the light, XX. I don't know what I'd do without the advice of a sewer rat like you.

Response1b:: Ugh, that's all I need. A farmer making me look bad at my own carnival.


Option2a:: Maybe he's just better than you at carnival games.

Option2b:: Maybe he's cheating.

Response2a:: Hmph. I don't have time to practice these games all day. It must be nice, not working a steady job. I really don't know how that fleabag survives here.

Response2b:: Maybe... nah, that doesn't seem like his style. I don't know him too well, but he doesn't seem dishonest to me.
