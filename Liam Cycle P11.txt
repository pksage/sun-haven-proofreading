Dialogue:: My back's been aching the last couple of days. Makes bending down a real pain!

Option1:: Have you been to the hospital for it yet?
Option2:: You should take it a little easier on yourself.

Response1:: Eh, I didn't really want to trouble anyone... I think it's fine, really. It's just a little crick in the back, you know?
Response2:: Yeah, you're right, XX. I should, but I've gotten so many orders lately. People in Sun Haven really depend on me, so I have a real hard time telling anyone "no".

Option1b:: Doctors like Wornhardt are here to help, you should get checked out. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response2b:: Something like that is just too hard for me. Look, can we forget I said anything, please? I'll just put up with the extra work. It's fine, really.
