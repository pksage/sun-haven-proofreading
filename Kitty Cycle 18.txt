Kitty Cycle 18

Dialogue:: Yesterday a man flew out of the sky! I told Lucia but I don't think she believed me...

Option1:: I believe you! //Emote none Happy
Option2:: What did this person want?

Response1:: Yeah? I knew you would believe Kitty, XX! Thank you for always being good to me, nya.[]The man said his name was Vaan. He was an Elf from the forest!
Response2:: I don't think he wanted anything, nya. He said he was only visiting. But he hid from the guards when they came by, and then he left! He was a funny guy, hehe.

Option1a:: Okay, now your story is getting a little far fetched. //Relationship Kitty18 -1 Mad
Option1b:: I hope he was nice to you. //Relationship Kitty18 2 Happy

Response1a:: Nyan!? You don't believe me after all...
Response1b:: He was very nice indeed, yep! He asked me what I do here. And then he gave me some greenroot, yuck!

Option2a:: It's weird that he didn't want anything.
Option2b:: I can't blame him for wanting to visit!

Response2a:: I had the same thought after he left. I guess Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
Response2b:: Me neither, nya! I had the same thought after he left. Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
