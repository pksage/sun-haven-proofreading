Catherine Cycle P14

Dialogue:: I'm thinking about my next birthday, I just can't decide what to get my littermates.

Option1:: Why would you get your littermates something for <i>your</i> birthday?
Option2:: I didn't know your birthday was coming up.

Response1:: Oh, well, it's their birthday too. We were all born on the same day, after all! It's tricky since there are seven of them...
Response2:: Oh, my birthday actually isn't for awhile! But with so many littermates, it takes all year to plan what I'm going to get for everyone.[]I want to go above and beyond so that everyone is happy, but it gets harder each year. I'm really struggling this time!

Option1a:: Your mom had eight kids at once?!
Option1b:: Is that the same for all Amari?

Response1a:: Well, yeah. What do you think a "litter" means, exactly? Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, others will have entire litters!
Response1b:: Nope! Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, while others will have entire litters! 

Option2a:: You could tell them their fortunes! //Relationship CatherineP14 2 Embarrassed
Option2b:: Yeah, good luck with that. //Relationship CatherineP14 -1 Mad

Response2a:: I love that idea![]Oh, but my littermates don't really like my witchcraft... too many pranks as a kid, hehe.
Response2b:: Right, thanks for all the help...
