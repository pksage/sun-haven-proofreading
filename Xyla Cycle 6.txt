Xyla Cycle 6

Dialogue:: If I keep seeing you around like this, I'm going to have to hide out in the carnival.

Option1:: Is that your favorite thing about Withergate - the carnival? //Emote none Happy

Option2:: So was the carnival your idea?


Response1:: Well, the carnival is great, but really the best thing about Withergate is my position here.[]The people here respect me, fear me, and desire me all at once. What more could I want?

Response2:: What do you think? Of course, that carnival is my baby! I didn't want to live in some boring city with no nightlife, so I pitched the idea.[]Thankfully the Demon King appreciates fun as much as I do. Now I have a great place to hang out and bragging rights to boot.


Option1a:: Why would you want to be feared? //Relationship Xyla6 -1 Mad

Option1b:: What - um - makes you think I desire you? //Relationship Xyla6 2 Romantic

Response1a:: Asked like a true commoner. Take notes, sewer rat: fear is power and power is freedom.[]When you ask why I want to be feared, what you're really asking is, "Why do you want to be free?"

Response1b:: Oh come on, sewer rat. You really think I haven't noticed you glancing up and down? Like I told you some time ago, we keep our eyes and ears open around here.


Option2a:: So you made it just so you wouldn't be bored here? //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: I've seen the carnival - it really is fun! //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: Of course. Oh, what have they got in Sun Haven again? A library? And you're telling me you don't get bored over there? Yeah, right.[]Just admit that we monsters know how to have more fun than those humans. Come on, I know you're thinking it!

Response2b:: You're darn right it is. What better way is there to bring people together than a carnival? You'll see, the success of Withergate will boil down to games and neon lights, with me to thank.
