Dialogue:: Hoy there! What can I help ya' with?

Option1:: What is this place?

Option2:: What's your story?


Response1:: Well, this is an aquarium. It's like a real fancy home for fish, where they can be taken care of and kept safe. More important than that, though, I can observe them for my research![]We're still in need of specimens. I got a whole lotta' tanks and no fish to fill 'em with! You're smart with a rod, right? Help me out with completing my collection, won't you?

Response2:: My whole family are fishermen. My father, all of my brothers - even Grandma. I guess I was the weird one who wanted to <i>study</i>  fish instead of catch them.[]Covington learned of my fascination with researching fish and offered me a job at this museum. It's a great setup, but, well, you can probably see that we're lacking specimens.[]My brother Peter promised he'd catch fish for my tanks, but he's too busy goofing off. If you want to help, you can examine the tanks to see which fish I still need. Just bring me a healthy specimen and put it in the tank. Easy.

Option1a:: I see.

Option2a:: I see.
