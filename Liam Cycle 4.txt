Liam Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Did you come by the bakery the other day? If you haven't you should come check it out.

Option1:: How's the bakery doing, anyway?

Option2:: Liam, what would be your fantasy baking project?


Response1:: Business has actually been really good. Oh no, what if I just jinxed it? I take it back!

Response2:: Wow, I haven't ever thought about that before... But, probably a wedding cake. A really really big one.


Option1a:: Well, I'm glad it's doing well. Even if you just jinxed it.

Option1b:: Are you doing anything different?

Response1a:: Just knowing that I can support myself and the girls is a weight off my mind.

Response1b:: That's the thing, I'm not. It's like the town itself is just getting a second wind. I don't get it, but I'm not about to question a good thing.


Option2a:: If I get married, I'm having you make the cake! //Relationship Liam4 2 Happy

Option2b:: Do you really think you could handle something like that? //Relationship Liam4 -1 Embarrassed

Response2a:: Really?? That's awesome, I'll start planning it![]Wait, no, nevermind. Too soon. It does sound fun though!

Response2b:: On second thought, I would probably screw it up and ruin the wedding.
