Claude Cycle 14

Dialogue:: Maybe one day we'll get out of Sun Haven. What do you think, XX?

Option1:: One step at a time, Claude.

Option2:: I'm curious, where would you live if you weren't in Sun Haven?


Response1:: You're right, I'm sorry. I haven't ever felt such excitement for the future. It's difficult not to indulge in fantasy.

Response2:: If I had my choice, probably somewhere in the Northern Region. I hear the cold is unforgiving. There must be a song somewhere in all that cold.


Option1a:: I would never leave Sun Haven with you. This is my home. //Relationship Claude14 -1

Option1b:: It doesn't matter where, Claude, as long as we're together. //Relationship Claude14 2 Happy

Response1a:: I see. I guess Sun Haven really grew on you. If I have to stay here longer, at least it's with you.

Response1b:: Everything you say to me is soothing to my mind. Right when my thoughts start racing, you come in and slow everything down. It's a really good thing for me, XX.


Option2a:: That's not what I expected at all.

Option2b:: That makes sense for you.

Response2a:: Well, the south is nothing but tourist trap islands. East and west are just more of the same. The north is the only place that offers anything different.

Response2b:: Well, the south is nothing but tourist trap islands. East and west are just more of the same. The north is the only place that offers anything different.
