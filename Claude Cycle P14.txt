Dialogue:: Hey there. How've you been? I've been a little bored lately, myself.

Option1:: Why have you been feeling bored?
Option2:: You should pick up another hobby.

Response1:: I suppose when I'm feeling uninspired, I get bored. I'm stuck with my music, and nothing is worse than a project half-realized. I either get it done, or I forget about it.
Response2:: What do you mean "another" hobby, XX? Are you saying my music is a hobby? My music is my entire life, it's never been a hobby.

Option1a:: What do you do to find inspiration?
Option1b:: Your music must take a long time to compose.

Response1a:: Sometimes I listen to my records. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.
Response1b:: It depends on how long I manage to stay inspired. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.

Option2a:: Good point. Find a hobby! //Relationship ClaudeP14 2
Option2b:: I mean, it's really just a hobby. //Relationship ClaudeP14 -1 Mad

Response2a:: A hobby, huh? I don't think I've ever tried to do anything other than music. But maybe it'll alleviate some of this infernal boredom. Something to think about, at least. Thanks.
Response2b:: It really isn't, XX. But why am I bothering to explain myself? I'll just go and suffer my boredom somewhere else.
