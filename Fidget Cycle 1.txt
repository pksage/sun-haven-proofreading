Dialogue:: Is that you I hear, XX? I wasn't sure if you were going to stick around, kekeke.

Option1:: What is seeing the world with your echo like?
Option2:: Why wouldn't I stick around?

Response1:: You're a curious person. I like that![]Okay, imagine that when you shouted you'd see a picture of everything around you. Does that make sense to you? Well, it would if you were a bat, kekeke.
Response2:: Well, you sounded like you were from that Human town. What's it called? <i>Sud</i> Haven?[]Anyway, I should have given you more credit. For someone from Sud Haven, you're more than meets the ear.

Option1a:: That sounds perfect for living in the dark.
Option1b:: I'd rather use my eyes to see.

Response1a:: Exactly. Why else do you think I came to a place like Withergate? Lots of darkness, plenty of stuff to do, and sights to hear.
Response1b:: Sure you do, until you're stuck in the dark. Then you'll wish you had my echo, kekeke.

Option2a:: It's <i>Sun</i> Haven, actually.
Option2b:: That's a compliment, right?

Response2a:: Are you sure? That doesn't sound right to me.
Response2b:: Kekeke, of course! I don't know what they say over in Sud Haven, but that's a genuine compliment among my people.
