Wornhardt Cycle P13

Dialogue:: Hey there, XX. I could go for a good mango right about now.

Option1:: Mango?
Option2:: How's Charlie doing?

Response1:: Oh, maybe you don't know. It's a type of fruit that grows all over the Southern Islands. I used to be able to eat them every day, if I wanted.
Response2:: Oh, so you remembered my little pet mouse, huh? Heh, no one usually bothers to ask me about Charlie. He's doing just fine, actually. As far as mice go, at least.[]Most people consider mice to be a pest, but that's such a limited way of thinking! Charlie doesn't think of himself as a pest, you know.

Option1a:: What's the best replacement for a mango that Sun Haven's got?
Option1b:: Could I grow a mango?

Response1a:: Hrm, the best replacement for a mango? I guess apples come the closest, but they're not quite the same.
Response1b:: I'm not so sure of that. They only grow on trees in very warm climates. I've never seen a mango tree this far north, at least.

Option2a:: It's just a mouse, you could've gotten rid of it. //Relationship WornhardtP13 -1 Mad
Option2b:: You're such a softie. //Relationship WornhardtP13 2 Embarrassed

Response2a:: Nope. Not my style, XX. It was Charlie's house first, that's how it is. I don't need to explain myself more than that. Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
Response2b:: What can I say? Just because Charlie is a mouse doesn't mean he's less important than I am! Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
