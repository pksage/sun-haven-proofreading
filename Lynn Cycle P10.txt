Lynn Cycle P10

Dialogue:: Solon is having me craft a set of very intricate gauntlets! It's precise work, so I'm trying really hard not to mess it up.

Option1:: "Gauntlets," those are a suit of armor's gloves, right?

Option2:: Why did Solon give you such a hard task?


Response1:: That's right. They go on the hands, so there's all the little finger pieces I have to do, and the palm measurements have to be super accurate.[]It's making me anxious just thinking about it, but I want to do my best.

Response2:: Solon says he sees a lot of potential in me, and that makes me really happy. But I also think he's testing me, and what if I fail?! Oh, XX, I can barely stand to think about it!


Option1a:: I'm sure you're more than capable.

Option1b:: Just do your best. If you mess up, you mess up.

Response1a:: Thanks for the vote of confidence, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.[]In a way, that leaves me feeling... excited.

Response1b:: I like your way of looking at it, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.[]In a way, that leaves me feeling... excited.


Option2a:: You're going to fail if you don't relax. //Relationship LynnP10 -1 Sad

Option2b:: Be honest with Solon and tell him you're having trouble. //Relationship LynnP10 2 Embarrassed

Response2a:: I know! That's just making it impossible for me to calm down! I should just tell Solon I'm not ready for this. He'll be disappointed, probably...

Response2b:: D-do you really think I should do that? He is my teacher, after all. Maybe he'll understand, or even help me out. Hmm, it's a little scary, but I think you're right, XX![]Or at least I hope you're right...
