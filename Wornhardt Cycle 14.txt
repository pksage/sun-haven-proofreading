Option2b:: Then this town is lucky to have us both. //Relationship Wornhardt14 2 Happy

Response2a:: Sorry, XX, but I need to keep my sense of humor. It's my defense mechanism as a doctor.

Response2b:: Sun Haven really has changed my life in every way possible. I know it did the same for you too, XX. You're right, we're both lucky for lots of reasons.
