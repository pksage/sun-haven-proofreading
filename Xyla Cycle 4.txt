Xyla Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Hey there, outsider. You look lost. The Human town is back where you came from!

Option1:: So do you have any hobbies - other than antagonizing people, that is? //Emote none Happy

Option2:: You know, I think I'm catching onto your act.


Response1:: Trying to get to know me? I'll play along.[]Yeah, I like to challenge my brain, since my body is perfect. Chess is my favorite game. Talk about strategy! I'm undefeated in Withergate - and that includes Darius. 

Response2:: Oh, are you now? I'm really, really curious - what is it you think you've caught onto?


Option1a:: Have you beaten the Demon King?

Option1b:: I've never played before.

Response1a:: The Demon King is too busy to play games. Besides, the best strategy against the king is not to play him in the first place - that's a lose-lose.

Response1b:: Well then, there's no point in playing against me. Maybe go practice for, oh, fifty years. Start against toddlers and work your way up. I'll be waiting at the top.


Option2a:: You're afraid to act nice because you fear rejection. //Relationship Xyla4 -1 Happy

Option2b:: You like to push people's buttons to see who breaks and who doesn't. //Relationship Xyla4 2 Romantic

Response2a:: That... is... HILARIOUS! You took your shot and missed by a mile, pal.

Response2b:: Well look at you, outsider. Of course I like pushing people's buttons - that's what buttons are for![]Heck, I'll admit, I'm surprised with you. The sewer rat has a brain after all!
