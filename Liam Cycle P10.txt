Dialogue:: Emma got into a sack of flour this morning. The handprints she left all over the floor were real cute, but it was a mess!

Option1:: Must have been a pain to clean the mess all on your own.
Option2:: So does this mean everything you bake is going to have Emma germs in it?!

Response1:: It might have been, but it wasn't really a big one. Besides, Emma helped clean it up! I can't get upset at her or anything, she's just a kid after all.[]I don't know if I would have it in me to ever be angry with either of my sisters, honestly.
Response2:: Don't worry, XX, it was just one sack. I threw it all out after we cleaned up.[]I love Emma to death, but that doesn't mean everyone wants her dirty little fingers all over the flour that made their bread. Even if her little fingers are so cute! 

Option1a:: It's hard to be angry at cute little Emma. //Relationship LiamP10 2 Happy
Option1b:: She shouldn't be causing that kind of trouble. //Relationship LiamP10 -1 Sad

Response1a:: Heh, yeah. We had a talk about staying out of the flour, and I think she'll behave now. She's a good kid, and I love her.
Response1b:: That's... true. Maybe I should be a little more strict with the girls, but it's so hard to get angry at them.

Option2a:: I'm just kidding, I know you wouldn't use that flour.  //Emote none Embarrassed
Option2b:: Whew, that's a relief.

Response2a:: Ah, oh, right! Heh, sometimes I don't catch on to jokes like that. I gotta lighten up, right?
Response2b:: Don't worry, we practice good hygiene at this bakery. Our flour will always be Emma free!
