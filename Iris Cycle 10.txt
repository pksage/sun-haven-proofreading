Iris Cycle 10

Dialogue:: You've been here a while now. Do you like Nel'Vari, XX?[]Sometimes I wish it was different, but I'm not sure how.

Option1:: If you could live somewhere else, where would you want to live?

Option2:: Life in Nel'Vari seems so peaceful, but do you ever get bored?


Response1:: I've heard that the Southern Islands are lush with exotic plants, which sounds amazing. I don't think I'd leave Nel'Vari for it, but it's a fun thought.

Response2:: Personally, I don't get bored. I keep busy with enchanting and the occasional woodworking.[]I know Vaan gets bored, though. That guy spends more time outside of Nel'Vari than inside, it seems like.


Option1a:: What WOULD you leave Nel'Vari for?

Option1b:: What would you do if you lived there?

Response1a:: I'm not quite sure. There's never been a reason to leave, so I haven't.[]I guess I just need a good reason. But it would have to be a really good one!

Response1b:: More of the same, probably. Enchanting, experimenting, some woodwork. Ooh, I bet my experiments would look completely different!


Option2a:: You're incredibly devoted to your profession, Iris. //Relationship Iris10 2

Option2b:: You should be more like Vaan. //Relationship Iris10 -1

Response2a:: What's that Human saying? "Practice makes it perfect?" Something like that.[]Anyway, I'm proud of my skills, so practicing a lot keeps me happy.

Response2b:: Hm, I don't think so. He spends a lot of time around other people. I need more time to myself.
