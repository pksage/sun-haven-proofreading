Reed Cycle 1

Dialogue:: The dirt seems extra fertile as of late. I wonder why that is.

Option1:: Are you a plant Amari?
Option2:: So do you eat food, or what?

Response1:: That's right, why do you ask? Haven't you met one of us before? There are several in this town alone, you know.
Response2:: I do not eat, but I make my own energy from sunshine. It makes life a lot more manageable. So much free time that would have been, well, "eaten up."

Option1a:: I didn't mean to gawk.
Option1b:: I've never seen someone like you before.

Response1a:: I simply thought that, since you found your way to Nel'Vari in the first place, you would have been a well-traveled adventurer. You still have a lot to learn, it seems.
Response1b:: That's surprising. I thought that, since you found your way to Nel'Vari in the first place, you would have been a well-traveled adventurer. You still have a lot to learn, it seems.

Option2a:: You make your own food <i>and</i> you tell jokes? //Relationship Reed1 2
Option2b:: That's the funniest joke I've ever heard a plant make! //Relationship Reed1 -1

Response2a:: I suppose all that extra time lets my mind wander. I'm bound to stumble on a joke here or there.
Response2b:: Please don't insult my intelligence. Plants are mindless beings. I am Amari, not plant.
