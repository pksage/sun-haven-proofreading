Lynn Cycle 13

Dialogue:: It feels like my life is really coming together. You're a big part of that, XX.

Option1:: Lynn, I love you, but... 

Option2:: You know, sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a different profession.


Response1:: But what? Don't keep me in anticipation, XX!

Response2:: Oh, sweet XX. When I started my apprenticeship, I was terrified! You remember, right? I constantly doubted my choice to move here.[]Now I'm almost at the end of my apprenticeship and I've learned almost everything Solon has to teach. What I'm trying to say is, just give it some time, sweetheart.


Option1a:: When you come home from the forge, you stink. Real bad. //Relationship Lynn13a -1 Mad

Option1b:: Would you mind taking a bath after you get home from the forge? //Relationship Lynn13a 2 Embarrassed

Response1a:: Well good, that's how you know I worked hard all day. I'm glad I stink!

Response1b:: Oh dear, I must smell like a sweat golem after a day's work! I'm glad you mentioned it, XX. I'll make sure to wash up when I get home.


Option2a:: That's not the same. I'm not a blacksmith. //Relationship Lynn13b -1

Option2b:: I don't know what I'd do without you, sweet pea. //Relationship Lynn13b 2 Happy

Response2a:: XX... I know you'll understand soon.

Response2b:: Oh stop, you'd be just fine on your own. And me, too. In a way, that's what makes us such a strong couple.
