Kara Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Oh, hello farmer. Good to see you out.


Option1:: I haven't seen you in town much.

Option2:: Pod seems like a handful.


Response1:: I don't go out a lot. Most days I just don't have the energy for an outing, especially after playing with Pod in the morning.

Response2:: He can be, but I like to see him living life his way. If he gets into a little trouble every now and then - so what? At least he's happy.


Option1a:: Are you okay?

Option1b:: Why are you so tired?

Response1a:: Oh yes, thank you. I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me.

Response1b:: I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me!


Option2a:: All that matters is that he's happy and safe. //Relationship Kara1 2

Option2b:: That doesn't seem very responsible. //Relationship Kara1 -1

Response2a:: I couldn't agree more.

Response2b:: Thanks for the parenting advice, farmer! But I'll raise my son how I like.
