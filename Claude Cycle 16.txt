Option2:: I look forward to the songs you'll compose throughout our lives together. //Emote none Happy

Response1:: It's impossible for me to imagine perfection. If I do something, then inherently it will have flaws. That's just how I've always been, and how I've done my music.[]But... I can't seem to find anything imperfect about us. It's new to me, but I think I can adjust.
Response2:: In the past, something like that might have made me feel as if I were put under pressure. But now, I feel excited. Inspired. This is the best I've ever felt in my life, maybe.[]I look forward to the songs I will compose during our marriage, too.

Response1b:: I didn't mean it like that, XX. I'm sorry if I upset you. 

Option2a:: It's nice to finally see you feeling so inspired. //Emote none Romantic
