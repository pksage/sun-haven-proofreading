Morpha Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome back, dearest.

Option1:: How long have you lived here?
Option2:: Is it rude to ask about your appearance?

Response1:: Me? Why, I've wandered these old forests for years and years... then one day, a city appeared out of nowhere!
Response2:: It's not in the question, but in how you ask! Don't worry, dearest, one can't help one's curiosity. Hee hee hee![]My appearance was altered this way when the ground gave way underfoot one day and I fell into a river! My potions must have spilled, because I left that river with this new face!

Option1a:: Were you upset about that?
Option1b:: What did you do?

Response1a:: Not in the least. Progress moves us forward, after all. Resisting progress is a foolish errand indeed, hee hee hee!
Response1b:: I moved in! Progress moves us forward, after all. Resisting progress is a foolish errand indeed, hee hee hee!

Option2a:: I don't think looks matter that much, anyway. //Relationship Morpha1 -1
Option2b:: I think you look fine! //Relationship Morpha1 2

Response2a:: I sure hope they do! Otherwise I'd be out of business - hee hee hee!
Response2b:: Ah... no need to warm an old maiden's heart over a false flame, dearest. I know how I look - and I don't care a wink! Hee hee hee!
