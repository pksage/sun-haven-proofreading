Anne Cycle 16

Dialogue:: I don't think you realize just how lucky you are, XX. I have a lot of suitors, you know. But you're the only one who ever got a ring on me.

Option1:: You had other suitors?
Option2:: Putting a ring on you was no easy feat! //Emote none Happy

Response1:: Well, they thought so. I never really had an interest in any of them despite the many, many gifts they sent me.[]I've gained admirers in a lot of places, but all of them want me the same way they want a pile of gold. You're the only person who's made me feel wanted as a person and not a trophy.

Response2:: Good! I've worked hard my entire life - it's time someone else worked hard for <i>me</i>![]When it comes down to it, it makes sense that the hardest worker won me over. And nobody works harder than a farmer! 

Option1a:: Who needs trophies when I've got you? //Relationship Anne16 2 Happy

Option1b:: You should have told me about these "suitors" earlier. //Relationship Anne16 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Heh, oh <i>please</i> get all sappy for me, XX. I think I'm warming up to your cheesy lines!

Response1b:: Really, XX? They were nothing to me, so why mention them?[]We're married, remember? You don't need to be so insecure.


Option2a:: I could say the same about you, Miss Renowned Merchant. //Emote none Romantic
Option2b:: I wasn't competing, I was only doing what I wanted to do. //Emote none Happy


Response2a:: Excuse me? That's <i>Mrs.</i> Renowned Merchant now!

Response2b:: That's the kind of thing that sets you apart from the others, XX. Did you hear yourself? You weren't even competing! Oh my, what style, what class!
