Jun Cycle P10

Dialogue:: Ah, XX. I was hoping to find you. Would you be interested in a town survey?

Option1:: Why are you doing a town survey?
Option2:: I'll bite. Show me the survey, Jun. //Emote none Happy

Response1:: It's nothing, really. I like to prepare little things like this from time to time, just to gauge how Sun Haven's citizens are feeling on certain topics.
Response2:: Excellent. I'm glad you don't mind taking the time to help out! Sometimes people get too busy for this stuff, but that's okay, too.[]Making Sun Haven the best it can be is a big part of why I do anything I do, so every voice counts![]Anyways, the survey is really just one question, but: What do you think of the town bulletin board?

Option1a:: You do too much, Jun! //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: I suppose that can be helpful information for your job. //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Ah, it's not necessarily something for my job! I just enjoy knowing how everyone feels on things.[]Sure, it comes back to help me as a counselor, but it's also just nice to get everyone's thoughts and feelings.
Response1b:: Ah, it's not necessarily something for my job! I just enjoy knowing how everyone feels on things.[]Sure, it comes back to help me as a counselor, but it's also just nice to get everyone's thoughts and feelings.

Option2a:: It's great! I don't have to talk to people as much. //Relationship JunP10 -1
Option2b:: It's a great way to see who needs help around town. //Relationship JunP10 2

Response2a:: I see. So you value it for the purpose of not needing to directly interact with others. Not exactly the real purpose of the bulletin board, but I suppose it's just how you feel.
Response2b:: So you're saying you feel pretty positive towards it? That's good to hear, XX. I believe helping one another is the best way to build a strong community!
