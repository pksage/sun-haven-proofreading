Vaan Cycle 11

Dialogue:: Have you met Iris yet? She was a big help with getting my house set up.

Option1:: Why is your house so far away from everyone else's?

Option2:: Is she a good friend of yours?


Response1:: I like it that way. It's a little quieter, a little more my own. It's important for me to have control of my own space.

Response2:: Iris? Sure, we've known each other for many years. Without Iris, many of the buildings in town wouldn't have been possible to build - like my house.[]She's the second strongest magic user in Nel'Vari - after me, of course.


Option1a:: That sounds a little isolated. //Relationship Vaan11 -1 Mad

Option1b:: That kind of solitude does sound peaceful. //Relationship Vaan11 2 Happy

Response1a:: It is, but that's the point. Maybe you don't share the same appreciation for solitude that I do.

Response1b:: That certainly factors in. The peace and quiet have allowed me time to meditate and focus on myself.


Option2a:: You say you're stronger? //Emote none Embarrassed

Option2b:: You said she helped build your house?

Response2a:: I only say that because I've mastered my practice. She's still learning the secrets of enchanting magic, I believe.

Response2b:: Maybe "build" isn't the right word. I had a vision of a home inside the trunk of a great tree, and she engineered it with her enchanting magic.
