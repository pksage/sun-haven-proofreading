Dialogue:: So Withergate's wannabe citizen returns to pester the prince. Don't you know how busy I am?

Option1:: Hopefully you have time to relax in your daily work as prince. //Emote none Mad

Option2:: The responsibilities of a prince must be a burden.


Response1:: Unsurprisingly, you continue to show your ignorance. I work when I want and take what free time I please, as a prince should.

Option1a:: I can only imagine what the prince does with his free time.

Option1b:: I envy you, my prince.

Response1a:: What I enjoy more than anything is observing my citizens. Sometimes I walk through my streets and give my goodwill to the loyalists. It's important to maintain my presence as prince.

Response1b:: What I enjoy more than anything is observing my citizens. Sometimes I walk through my streets and give my goodwill to the loyalists. It's important to maintain my presence as prince.


Option2a:: We aren't so different. //Relationship Darius3 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Brash fool... The dirt on my heels has seen greater luxury than you will in your entire life.
