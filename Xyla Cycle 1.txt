Xyla Cycle 1

Dialogue:: You again? What, are you bored of Sun Haven?[]Oh, you actually want to talk. This should be good!

Option1:: Wait, how do you know I'm from Sun Haven?

Option2:: Who even are you?


Response1:: Unlike your Human town, we keep our eyes and ears open around here. You should take a page out of our book and get some real security.

Response2:: I'm Xyla, and that's the only time I'll tell you my name, so don't bother asking again. I'm surprised a sewer rat like you made it to Withergate on your own.


Option1a:: Have you been spying on Sun Haven?

Option1b:: Sun Haven has security... //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Well, <i>I</i> haven't been spying...[]Don't get so worked up, it's barely spying. Besides, it's just a precaution. You do know what precautions are, don't you?

Response1b:: Those guards may as well be sleepwalking. Matter of fact, I've actually seen one sleeping on duty before! If you ask me, your Human armies are just adorable.


Option2a:: That's not very nice. //Relationship Xyla1 -1 Sad

Option2b:: I'm surprised a rude monster like you has any place in this town. //Relationship Xyla1 2 Romantic

Response2a:: Oops, didn't mean to hurt your feelings, sewer rat. Don't go springing a leak, now.

Response2b:: Oh, you've got teeth? That's good, I like that! Sometimes you have to bite to get by in these parts.
