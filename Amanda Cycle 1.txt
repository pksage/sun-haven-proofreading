Amanda Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Hello. Unless you need something from me, go ahead and grab a book.


Option1:: Are you from Sun Haven?

Option2:: How many books have you read?


Response1:: Yes, I'm a native here. The library was a comfortable place for me when I was a kid. Still is, too.

Response2:: I don't know. Probably about equal to the number of head injuries you've had.


Option1a:: Was this your dream job as a kid, then?

Option1b:: I don't blame you, libraries are so cozy.

Response1a:: My dream job as a kid was to be a dragon. This was a pretty close second.

Response1b:: And they're usually so quiet too. You know. Usually.


Option2a:: I actually believe that! //Relationship Amanda1 2

Option2b:: You don't have to be rude. //Relationship Amanda1 -1

Response2a:: To your credit, you sure know how to take a joke.

Response2b:: And you don't have to distract me.
