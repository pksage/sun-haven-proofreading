Dialogue:: Oh hi there, XX. I hope your day is going well.[]Me? My arms are sore today.

Option1:: Don't you get tired of working so hard? 

Option2:: What made you want to be a blacksmith?


Response1:: Sure I do. I try not to complain though. It's like Solon says, "Every breath goes into the forge."[]At least I'm learning a lot. In the end, I just want my family to be proud of me.

Response2:: In the Eastern Region, women are the blacksmiths. My mother and grandmother supported our whole family with smithing, so I guess you could say it's in my blood.


Option1a:: Your work should be for yourself, not for other people. //Relationship Lynn2a -1

Option1b:: You'll make your family proud, I know it. //Relationship Lynn2a 2 Happy

Response1a:: In my village, the only people that think that way don't have any friends or family.

Response1b:: Aw, thank you XX. I'll have to make you some fantastic armor one day! 


Option2a:: Tradition is nice, but how do you know if this is what you really want? //Relationship Lynn2b -1

Option2b:: Tradition is important. It's good that you're representing your culture. //Relationship Lynn2b 2 Happy

Response2a:: When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. It's too bad you don't share that feeling or else I'm sure you'd understand.

Response2b:: When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. I'm glad you understand that kind of connection, too.
