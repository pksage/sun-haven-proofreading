Dialogue:: Lucia has asked me to compose a "town anthem" for Sun Haven. I'd like to decline, but she seemed really excited about it.

Option1:: Do you not want to compose a town anthem for Sun Haven?
Option2:: If Lucia asked you personally, she must really want you to do it.

Response1:: Not especially, no. It's a quaint idea, but I just don't know what Lucia would be expecting. It seems like it's doomed to fail.
Response2:: She does. She spoke a lot about "pride in Sun Haven" all that. I like living in Sun Haven, but I can't really see myself composing music in its honor.

Option1a:: You have a pretty sour attitude about it. //Relationship ClaudeP15 -1 Sad
Option1b:: Try asking Lucia to clarify what she wants. //Relationship ClaudeP15 2

Response1a:: Oh well. Call it what you want, it's just how I feel.
Response1b:: That is one option, yes. If I'm really going to go through with this request, of course. I suppose at the very least I can ask her exactly what she wants from me.

Option2a:: If you aren't inspired then the music wouldn't be good, anyways. //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: Lucia asked you, so you should really try. //Relationship ClaudeP15 -1 Embarrassed

Response2a:: It's good you know me well enough to understand that I can't just force music to happen. I'll just have to explain that to Lucia next time we talk. 
Response2b:: I can't just force myself to write music, XX. It doesn't work like that.
