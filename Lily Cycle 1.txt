Lily Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Hey, XX! I hope your day is as good as mine!

Option1:: Gorwin mentioned that you have a lot of hobbies.
Option2:: How do you stay so cheerful?

Response1:: Oh yes, absolutely! There's too much interesting stuff in this world, and not enough time to do it all.
Response2:: Something I learned early on is that life is different when you're living on the ground. I can't always be the most helpful since I'm so small, but I <i>can</i> keep a good attitude!

Option1a:: What kind of things?
Option1b:: What's holding you back?

Response1a:: Oh my, there are so many. But my favorites? They have to be reading, fishing, and painting![]It is tricky holding a paintbrush in my mouth, though.
Response1b:: Well, I've just got too many interests to manage in a day. I've been working on a new routine to fit my favorite hobbies in every day![]Oh, and the fact that I don't have any arms yet is... problematic.

Option2a:: That's a lovely perspective. //Relationship Lily1 2
Option2b:: It still seems like you can't help out much. //Relationship Lily1 -1

Response2a:: That's true in more ways than one, heh! I see things most people miss every day - beetles, worms, funny blades of grass. There's a whole world at your feet!
Response2b:: Maybe so, but thinking that way doesn't help. I hope you can change your perspective, too!
