Solon Cycle 3

Dialogue:: Is that what you're wearing for armor? You should upgrade if you're expecting trouble.


Option1:: How would I upgrade my armor?

Option2:: Have you seen Elios?


Response1:: You've got two options. The first is to put work into your smelter and anvil and make it yourself. The second is to bring me the gold to make it for you.

Response2:: Of course I have. I've lived here all my life, haven't I?


Option1a:: I'll make it myself. //Relationship Solon3 2

Option1b:: I can't make it as well as you. //Relationship Solon3 -1

Response1a:: Good for you, kid. Don't quit working at it. You only get better with practice, you know.

Response1b:: Not yet you can't. One day, who knows? You only get better with practice, you know.


Option2a:: Are you upset that he didn't give you his blessing? 

Option2b:: What did he say to you? 

Response2a:: That's not something to get upset about. Making a fuss because you weren't given a gift? That's behaving like a child.

Response2b:: I don't remember it word-for-word. It was some time back, now.[]It might've been, "As a newborn dragon breaks from the egg, your future will be born of flame."[]Have to say, he hit the nail on the head with that one.
