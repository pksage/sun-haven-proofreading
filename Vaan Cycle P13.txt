Vaan Cycle P13

Dialogue:: I've been making strides in my work with Nivara lately. You should spend some time with the World Dragon if you're ever feeling spiritually lost.

Option1:: I thought you'd already mastered your magic?
Option2:: Are you very spiritual, Vaan?

Response1:: Sure I have, but Nivara still has plenty to teach. Her wisdom spans farther than just magic, anyway.[]I'm talking about spirituality, XX! You must be slightly familiar with the concept.
Response2:: Heh, you still have a thing or two to learn about Elven society, XX.[]Spirituality is part of every Elf's life on some level. It's important for my magic, so I focus on it quite a bit.

Option1a:: Sure I am!  //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: I am not, actually.

Response1a:: Oh yeah? That's great! I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught similar lessons. It's good knowing that Nivara isn't the only source of wisdom in the world.
Response1b:: Oh, no? I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught you that kind of stuff along with the usual blessing. I guess not all dragons can dispense wisdom like Nivara.

Option2a:: Spirituality doesn't help me with my magic, though. //Relationship VaanP13 -1 Mad
Option2b:: That explains why your magic is so strong. //Relationship VaanP13 2 Happy

Response2a:: XX, your ignorance is showing. Your spirit comes into play with every use of magic, no matter if you realize it or not.
Response2b:: It's certainly part of the reason, yes. You could probably have a similar experience if you focused more on your own spirituality!
