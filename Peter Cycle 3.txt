Peter Cycle 3

Dialogue:: I caught a huge fish last night! It was too beautiful to keep, so I let it go.[]... Okay, it broke my line.


Option1:: Does that happen a lot?

Option2:: That's unlucky. You'll get it next time.


Response1:: Not with my lines, but this was one tough customer. I fought it for a full hour!

Response2:: That's the right attitude. A fisherman's best tool is patience. I learned that from an old fish-trapper while I was waiting out a storm in the east.[]Can you believe they do all their fishing with traps over there? It's true, no lines or nets!


Option1a:: It sounds like your gear failed you. //Relationship Peter3 -1

Option1b:: Some fish are really amazing. //Relationship Peter3 2

Response1a:: My equipment is top-notch, buddy. You think you can make a stronger line? Be my guest.

Response1b:: No kidding! This isn't a loss for me though - it's a challenge. One day, I'll catch that fish.


Option2a:: Do you use traps?

Option2b:: Do traps work better than rods?

Response2a:: Nah, I prefer the struggle between fish and man. The instant you get a bite on the hook is a special experience. For a split-second, nothing else in the world matters.

Response2b:: Maybe for small fish, but I'm always after the big fish. You strike me as a big fish kind of person, too!
