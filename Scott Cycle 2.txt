Scott Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Nice day today. Are you going into the forest? You should be prepared.


Option1:: Where do you get your weapons?

Option2:: Have you ever been caught unprepared before?


Response1:: I'm a traveling merchant, so I know how to spot quality. Whenever I see some good iron on the road, I barter for it. That's real trade, kid.

Response2:: I've been in an ambush once before, but I've always got something sharp on me. Really, those bandits caught themselves unprepared!


Option1a:: What if you get scammed?

Option1b:: How long have you been doing this?

Response1a:: Sure, that's happened once or twice. What happens is I learn from it and try not to let it happen again.[]And if I happen to find the person who scammed me, then I'll give them a conversation they won't likely forget.

Response1b:: I can't say exactly, but I can tell you that my hair was black when I started!


Option2a:: Your job sounds dangerous. //Relationship Scott2 -1

Option2b:: It sounds like you can really handle yourself.  //Relationship Scott2 2

Response2a:: Might be, yeah. That's why it's not for whiners to do. You might stick with farming, kid.

Response2b:: I spend all day around these weapons, don't you think I play with them a bit?
