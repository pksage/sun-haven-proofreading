Dialogue:: We've come so far together, XX. I think Sun Haven is really on the cusp of growing truly great.

Option1:: Why are you always so concerned with Sun Haven?
Option2:: I'm glad I get to share this time with you. //Emote none Happy

Response1:: I gave my life to Sun Haven. It was part of answering a 'higher calling' for me.[]I also gave my life to you, but I'll always have to balance between being the Archmage and being your wife.
Response2:: There's no one else in the world I'd rather be with right now than you, XX.[]We both worked very hard to turn Sun Haven around, and now we can watch the fruits of those labors together.

Response1b:: I know it won't always be the most ideal, but you're the one I chose to spend the rest of my life with. Just try with me and I think you'll see that it will work.

Option2a:: Does this mean you'll take your job easier from now on?
Option2b:: I'm ready to work for the future with you, Lucia.

Response2a:: Not at all! If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
Response2b:: I'm ready too, XX. If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
