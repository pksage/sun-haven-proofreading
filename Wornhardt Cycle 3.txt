Wornhardt Cycle 3

Dialogue:: Hey XX, having fun yet? There's always something to do here![]I spend a lot of time just exploring the town. When I'm not working, of course.

Option1:: Do you have any hobbies just for fun?

Option2:: Do you have a favorite spot around town?


Response1:: I like cooking big meals for myself, if you count that. I usually make too much, though. Say, I should give you some leftovers the next time I cook.

Response2:: I just love the windmills on the way to the beach. You've seen them by now, right?[]Try this, lie in the grass and watch the windmills spin against the sky. Without fail, it always takes my mind away. The way they spin in unison is mesmerizing. I wonder, how do they do that?


Option1a:: You shouldn't waste food like that. //Relationship Wornhardt3 -1 Mad

Option1b:: That sounds great! I bet you're a fantastic cook. //Relationship Wornhardt3 2

Response1a:: Relax XX, I don't waste food. I share with my pet mouse, Charlie. Let's not make assumptions about each other, okay?

Response1b:: Hey, don't take my word for it. Bring me some potatoes and I'll make you a great egg hash!


Option2a:: I'll have to try it!

Option2b:: Spinning things make me dizzy...

Response2a:: Just be careful not to get sunburned. I fell asleep out there once and came back looking like Peter's pet crab.

Response2b:: In that case, there's always the beach - plenty of natural beauty there, too. That's the thing about Sun Haven, you find beauty no matter where you look.
