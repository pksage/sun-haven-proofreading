Vaan Cycle 5

Dialogue:: XX, I was just wondering something about you. I don't want to ask anything that might make you uncomfortable, though.

Option1:: What's on your mind?

Option2:: Vaan, you can ask me whatever you want anytime.  //AddItem none Vaan'sRubyRing 1


Response1:: Well, it's a couple things... but I was thinking about my connection to magic. It seems to be... louder than usual, if that makes sense.

Response2:: I know that. I'm a little astonished with you, XX. I can already tell that you're an important person in my life. Someone who will change me for the better.[]Because of that, I want to give you something. It's my ruby ring.


Option1a:: I don't have much of a connection to magic. //Relationship Vaan5 -1 Sad

Option1b:: My connection to magic has been getting stronger, too. //Relationship Vaan5 2 Happy

Response1a:: Is that true? Hm, that's surprising to hear. I thought someone like you would be attuned to magical energies. Just don't close yourself off to the idea, okay?

Response1b:: Ah, that's interesting. So you think it means I'm getting stronger? You might be right, actually. But it's a very intense feeling. I just don't know what started it.[]I noticed it not long after meeting you, actually. I wonder if... Hm, I should talk to Nivara.


Option2a:: Your ruby ring?

Option2b:: Is this important?

Response2a:: Yes, it has great personal value to me. I trust you to take care of it, and it should help keep you safe, too. I know you won't lose it, XX.

Response2b:: Yes, it has great personal value to me. I trust you to take care of it, and it should help keep you safe, too. I know you won't lose it, XX.
