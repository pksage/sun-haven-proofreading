Darius Cycle 13

Dialogue:: XX, my sweet. You're radiant as ever in tonight's darkness.

Option1:: I never knew you to be so sweet!

Option2:: It's time I asked... is there a story behind your sword?


Response1:: I put on a strong front for the people, as a prince must. But you're not "people", XX. I want to be authentic with you.

Response2:: This sword... Yes indeed, but I don't know how you'll feel about it.[]When Demons reach the end of their life, their bodies become as stone. The stone is different for each Demon, but stronger Demons make harder stone.[]When my grandfather passed, his last wish was to continue serving his people. Then he became a hard, shining red stone almost like glass.[]We forged my grandfather into this sword to honor his last wish. He is always with me, as my protector.


Option1a:: I like this authentic version of you. //Emote none Happy

Option1b:: What if everyone in Withergate saw you like this? //Emote none Embarrassed 

Response1a:: Of course you do! But don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.

Response1b:: Don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.[]Besides, nobody would believe you anyway. And if they did, I would lock them up.


Option2a:: Wasn't there a less creepy way to honor him? //Relationship Darius13 -1 Mad

Option2b:: That's a beautiful way to honor him. //Relationship Darius13 2 Happy

Response2a:: If you think that's creepy, then don't bother asking what we did with Grandmother.

Response2b:: I think so too. In fact, I want the same thing for myself one day. One day in the far, far future, of course.
