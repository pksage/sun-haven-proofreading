Xyla Cycle 10

Dialogue:: You know, in the right light you don't look half bad, XX!

Option1:: Hold on, I think that's the first time you've ever used my real name! //Emote none Romantic

Option2:: That was barely a compliment, by the way.


Response1:: Don't worry, you'll always be a sewer rat to me.

Response2:: That's about as good as my compliments get. But maybe I'm just lacking a good example. Go ahead, farmer, lay one on me.


Option1a:: Well, I wouldn't want you to like me too much.

Option1b:: And you'll always be a bully!

Response1a:: Don't get ahead of yourself. I like you, but we're not best friends or anything like that.

Response1b:: Aw, you do know me! How sweet of you, XX.


Option2a:: Your breath is tolerable today. //Relationship Xyla10 2 Happy

Option2b:: Your strength is rivaled only by your beauty. //Relationship Xyla10 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Aw, you mean it? That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me! Thanks, XX, you really know how to treat a girl right.

Response2b:: ... I don't know what I was prepared for, but it was not that. I think I'm sick to my stomach.
