Donovan Cycle 9

Dialogue:: You're looking pretty buff, XX. Is that from farming or fighting?[]Either way, keep it up and you'll have nothing to fear in this town!

Option1:: You seem pretty fearless, but I wonder... what scares you, Donovan?

Option2:: Is there anybody in town that you would be afraid to fight?


Response1:: Okay sure, I'll tell you. But only because we're getting to know each other pretty well. And you have to keep it quiet. This is a test to see if I can trust you, XX! Don't blow it.

Response2:: Hm... Not Darius... Not Xyla... Maybe Arianella, the seamstress... Actually, the only person I can think of is you, XX.


Option1a:: You can trust me. //Emote none Embarrassed

Option1b:: Out with it already. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1a:: I can't swim to save my life. For some reason, I sink like a bag of rocks. I just can't keep my head above water.[]Maybe I need to gain some weight or something. Anyway, now you know. So don't tell!

Response1b:: I can't swim to save my life. For some reason, I sink like a bag of rocks. I just can't keep my head above water.[]Maybe I need to gain some weight or something. Anyway, now you know. So don't tell!


Option2a:: You're right, I would cream you. //Relationship Donovan9 -1 Embarrassed

Option2b:: I wouldn't want to fight you, Donovan! //Relationship Donovan9 2 Happy

Response2a:: Whoa whoa whoa - that's not what I meant at all! Good to know where you stand though, sheesh.

Response2b:: That's exactly my point, I think I actually like you too much. Heck, I'd rather get crushed by the club bouncer than have to fight you.
