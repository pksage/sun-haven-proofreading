Dr. Hopsan Barley Cycle 1

Dialogue:: I'm not surprised you're back. It isn't every day you meet a master of his craft!


Option1:: What exactly do you make again?

Option2:: What brought you to Withergate?


Response1:: I make beverages of all kinds: drinks, libations, quenchers, and potations too! I've dedicated my whole life to the perfection of brewcraft.

Response2:: I thought this would be a good spot to sell my brews and maybe learn a thing or two about brewcraft. But to be honest, I was hesitant to come after all I heard about this city.[]I nearly turned around before entering Withergate because I wasn't sure what kind of people I would find here. Monsterfolk aren't my usual crowd - me being a regular house cat and all.


Option1a:: Are you working on anything special?

Option1b:: What is the best drink you've made?

Response1a:: But of course! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet and refreshing...[]Nothing motivates me more than the thought of that first, crisp sip of golden ale!

Response1b:: The best drink is the one I've yet to make! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet, crisp, and refreshing...[]Every night I dream of that first sip of fizzy golden ale!


Option2a:: I'd say you fit in just fine here. //Relationship Dr. Hopsan Barley1 2

Option2b:: I don't know if I would call you a "regular" house cat. //Relationship Dr. Hopsan Barley1 -1

Response2a:: You think so, do you? Well, that's good, then! I don't want to seem unapproachable to the people here.

Response2b:: What in the world do you mean? Is it the goggles?
