Dialogue:: You again! I hope I can interview you soon for your experience as a farmer. You could provide some useful information for my book.


Option1:: You're writing a book?

Option2:: So you're here doing research?


Response1:: That's right, I'm calling it the Worldly Compendium. It will be a collection of, well, everything anybody knows about anything!

Option1a:: That sounds like a lot.

Option1b:: Is that possible?

Response1a:: Oh, sure. It will be the biggest reference book to ever exist by far, but it's worth the work.[]Can you imagine, all the information you ever needed in one place? It's never been done before!

Option2a:: You're a fast worker! //Relationship Eve1 2

Option2b:: Books aren't really a priority. //Relationship Eve1 -1

Response2a:: It's the nature of the work. It's also why I work alone, because nobody can keep up. Unfortunately, this also means I have to do all the work by myself.

Response2b:: I have to disagree! Books are vessels of knowledge. I don't believe there's ever a time when knowledge is not a priority.
