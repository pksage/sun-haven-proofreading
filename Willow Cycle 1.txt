Willow Cycle 1

Dialogue:: You must be here to judge my power as an enchantress, right?

Option1:: I wouldn't judge you - you're just a kid.
Option2:: What do you want to do with enchanting?

Response1:: Just a kid?? That does it! When I learn enchanting as strong as Iris does it then I'll show you! You just made yourself a lifelong enemy.
Response2:: I wanna be even stronger than Iris one day. Then I can help the town and be loved by everyone, just like her!

Option1a:: I didn't mean to offend you, miss. //Relationship Willow1 2
Option1b:: Good luck, kid. //Relationship Willow1 -1

Response1a:: Miss? ... Okay, I forgive you! Being lifelong enemies sounds hard anyways.
Response1b:: I won't need luck to teach you a lesson!

Option2a:: Everyone loves Iris?
Option2b:: So you just want other people to like you?

Response2a:: Of course they do! I think some people are a little scared of her, though.[]But not me, she's my hero!
Response2b:: Not just that, but I also want to have cool magic stuff in my house like she does. She's just <i>so cool</i>.
