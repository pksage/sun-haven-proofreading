Dialogue:: Hey, XX, I'm happy to see you.[]I've actually been meaning to ask you... I was thinking we could go visit your farm together. What do you think?

Option1:: I didn't know you liked my farm so much.

Option2:: What if we had a date right here in Nel'Vari? //Emote none Embarrassed


Response1:: Didn't I mention before that it's beautiful? You've really done well with it.[]I used to sit on a hill nearby to think about all the future possibilities. I know it sounds a little vague, but I guess it's like... reflecting on the future, if that makes sense?

Response2:: Oh! A - a date? You really mean it? That... that would be fine with me, XX!


Option1a:: What do you reflect on?

Option1b:: I don't quite understand.

Response1a:: I reflect on lots of things. Simply put, the things I'll do and the things I won't do. I'm captivated by the idea of having opportunities.[]It's the idea that I can pick and choose from any future - just reach out and grab it if I want to. Knowing I have this capability feels almost more powerful than my wind magic.

Response1b:: It's the idea that I can pick and choose from any future - just reach out and grab it if I want to. Knowing I have this capability feels almost more powerful than my wind magic.
