Anne Cycle 14

Dialogue:: You know, if you let me invest in your farm we could really increase production!

Option1:: You think I need help on the farm?

Option2:: Not everyone is so focused on productivity, Anne. //Emote none Happy


Response1:: It's not about needing help, it's about expansion! Hire some workers, buy a little more land... I usually charge for this kind of advice, you know!

Response2:: And not everyone gets to wear solid gold jewelry, but to each their own I guess!


Option1a:: I know you're just thinking about what's best for my future. //Relationship Anne14 2 Happy

Option1b:: I don't need any of your help with my farm. //Relationship Anne14 -1 Mad

Response1a:: You're darn right I am! That's all I think about, you know. The future. Investments.[]We've got a very long road ahead of us, XX, and I want to pave it with gold.

Response1b:: I know that, but - oh, forget it. Stubborn farmers...


Option2a:: Do you even like wearing all that jewelry?

Option2b:: I really shouldn't be surprised by that answer.

Response2a:: Hey, I have an image to protect! And that image is sparkly and expensive.

Response2b:: No, you shouldn't! I wear my priorities on my sleeve. And on my ears, and around my neck. Get it?
