Dialogue:: Can't you feel the vibration of my wings? It feels so good to be buzzing!

Option1:: What brought you to Nel'Vari?
Option2:: Last we spoke, you said that you pollinate?

Response1:: Oh, I was just minding my own business one day, making sure all my bees were hard at work, when I had a vision! That took me by surprise, let me tell ya.[]In the vision, I saw a dragon draped with flowers and vines. Turns out, Nivara was calling me directly! She was looking for help keeping the plants healthy around here. Of course, I happily offered my help.[]Elves are hard workers, but nobody works as hard as a bee!
Response2:: That's right! Hold on now... judging by your face, I'd guess you don't even know what that means![]Wow, you're really without a clue, aren't ya? Don't worry honey, Beeanca will help you.

Response1a:: Not everyone likes to work so much, but me and my bees get such satisfaction from a job well done. Just look around you! All these healthy plants - most of them are here because of me and my bees!

Option2a:: So are you going to tell me?
Option2b:: I don't really care anymore.
