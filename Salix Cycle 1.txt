Dialogue:: I see when you look at me. Why?

Option1:: Not to be rude, but where did you come from?
Option2:: I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.

Response1:: I come from here. From the dirt here.
Response2:: Nobody makes me uncomfortable, especially not you.

Option1a:: So you just grew naturally?
Option1b:: Did you learn how to talk by yourself?

Response1a:: Mm, no. Not natural. I'm made this way by Iris. Nivara, too. They made me sprout and gave me thoughts. Happier this way.
Response1b:: Mm, no. Not natural. I'm made this way by Iris. Nivara, too. They made me sprout and gave me thoughts. Happier this way.

Option2a:: You could call us friends! //Relationship Salix1 2
Option2b:: I guess it means, "not happy." //Relationship Salix1 -1

Response2a:: Friends? Of course. Many here in Nel'Vari are my friend, such as Flemmett. You are a friend, too. Good, good!
Response2b:: Hmm? You don't want me to be happy? Hm, how sad...
