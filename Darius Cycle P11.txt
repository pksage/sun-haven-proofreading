Darius Cycle P11

Dialogue:: It seems Xyla has made a mistake with the castle's plumbing. Completely unacceptable.

Option1:: Xyla has always served you well, right? What's wrong?
Option2:: Having trouble running the city?

Response1:: She's made an error concerning some petty civic scheduling. A rare blunder for her, but an unacceptable one all the same.
Response2:: Running Withergate is always a challenge. Which is why mistakes are not tolerated, no matter who makes them.

Option1a:: You should take it easier on her. //Relationship DariusP11 -1 Mad
Option1b:: Well, small mistakes can add up. //Relationship DariusP11 2

Response1a:: Feh! "Take it easy on her?" Mercy is a key ingredient in laziness. Xyla's job is too important to allow her to slip up...[]Today it might be a small blunder, but tomorrow it might be the city's undoing.  
Response1b:: I'm glad you understand, XX. Maybe it makes me harsh, but so what? I'm not trying to be the nicest Demon in Withergate.[]Sometimes the hand that rules must do so... sternly. 

Option2a:: What about the times when you mess up? //Emote none Mad
Option2b:: Doesn't seem like such a big deal. //Relationship DariusP11 -1 Mad

Response2a:: Don't you think I hold myself to the same standards? I can't make any mistakes either. I am prince, soon to be king. Every problem is ultimately my responsibility.
Response2b:: I came to believe you had better foresight, XX. It seems, however, that you merely long for the days when your opinion meant nothing to me.
