Slate Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome back! Looking for something sweet to sip on?

Option1:: When did you learn to brew?
Option2:: Is this place all yours?

Response1::  I taught myself! It didn't take long, only a few years of trial and error. Luckily I had a town full of taste-testers to help!
Response2:: Oh no, I wouldn't claim this space as my own. It's part of the Grand Tree, after all. It's more of a communal space, really.

Option1a:: Teaching yourself sounds tough. Good work! //Relationship Slate1 2
Option1b:: It took you that long?? //Relationship Slate1 -1

Response1a:: Heh, well it's easy when you've got the time. You'll find that many of us in Nel'Vari have a <i>lot</i> of free time. Just talk to Caspian or Quincy and you'll see what I mean.
Response1b:: I didn't have a teacher or anything, so I don't think it's that strange...

Option2a:: How come you're the only one working?
Option2b:: Don't you wish the others would help?

Response2a:: Simply put... it's what I love to do! Showing hospitality and warmth is what Nel'Vari should be all about, so I'm here doing my part.[]Not to mention, I get all the free honeybrew I can drink!
Response2b:: Not really. Honestly, it's what I love to do! Showing hospitality and warmth is what Nel'Vari should be all about, so I'm here doing my part.[]Not to mention, I get all the free honeybrew I can drink!
