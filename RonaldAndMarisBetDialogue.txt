Dialogue:: Hey Mari, XX is here. I bet they can settle this. What do you say, XX, want to settle a bet for us?


Option1:: Do you two bet against each other often?

Option2:: What are the stakes?

Option3(Permanent):: What's the bet?


Response1:: Sure, we keep things interesting. Sometimes we disagree, but it's more fun to make a bet out of it!

Response2:: If you prove me wrong, I'll reward you handsomely!

Response3:: I say nobody in town is brave enough to go to the forest and slay <color=#39CCFF>5 Leafies</color>. Even the guards seem too soft! As usual, Mari thinks I'm wrong.


Option3a:: Sure, I'll prove you wrong! //Quest none RonaldAndMarisBetQuest

Response3a:: Big talk! But let's see how you feel when you're staring those monsters in the face. (End)

Response3b:: You see? I knew you wouldn't be up for it. (End)
