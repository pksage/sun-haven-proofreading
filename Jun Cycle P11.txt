Jun Cycle P11

Dialogue:: Hello again. How's your day? I just got out of a session with a client, myself.

Option1:: What did you and your client talk about?
Option2:: How many people do you work with in Sun Haven?

Response1:: Now that I can never tell you! Sorry, XX. It's really nothing personal, but I cannot discuss clients with other people. It's all very private, you know.[]I apologize if it comes off as strict, but I take that part of my job incredibly seriously.
Response2:: Hm, well, that's something I think would be okay to answer.[]I work with lots of people, to put it broadly. Some of my clients I see weekly, but some I've only seen once or twice as they work through an issue.[]It doesn't matter how often they need me, though. I'm always here for whenever they do.

Option1a:: I understand, don't worry about it. //Relationship JunP11 2 Happy
Option1b:: Boring. I wanna hear the juicy details. //Relationship JunP11 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Thank you. You won't believe how pushy some people can be about wanting to know who I talk to and about what![]Heh, people are just naturally curious, though.
Response1b:: I understand you might be curious, XX, but I cannot violate a client's privacy. I admit I'm a bit disappointed you'd even ask...

Option2a:: Where do you find the time to make it all work? //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: Your schedule must be all over the place. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response2a:: Sometimes even I'm not so sure! But it's all part of what I do. I have to find time for a client if I want to help them, after all.
Response2b:: It's true, I have a bit of a messy plate most of the time. But it's worth it, in order to accommodate everyone.
