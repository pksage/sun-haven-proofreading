Dynus Cycle 7

Dialogue:: You've returned... Speak, or cease wasting my time.

Option1:: Do you know Elios?
Option2:: Why do you spread darkness and not light?

Response1:: Yes... the Sun Dragon... Elios and I have a history that spans your lifetime... countless times over.
Response2:: Darkness is part of my soul... something I did not choose, but that always was. Even the guardian dragons... are subject to their fate.


Option1a:: His power is nothing compared to yours. //Relationship Dynus7 2
Option1b:: He's the most powerful dragon I've met. //Relationship Dynus7 -1


Response1a:: Truer words have never been spoken... The Sun Dragon is mighty in name only. His light will soon be overcome... by my darkness.

Response1b:: Insolent whelp... You will soon realize how wrong you are.


Option2a:: So you can't spread light?
Option2b:: So your power isn't unlimited after all.


Response2a:: I can dissipate the darkness to make light... but that would be pointless. Light is a crutch... for those without real power.

Response2b:: As far as it concerns the likes of you... there is no difference.
