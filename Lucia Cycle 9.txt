Lucia Cycle 9

Dialogue:: Hello XX! Oh my, you appear to have gotten a little too much sun. Your cheeks are extra rosey today!

Option1:: I've been outside a lot lately, I guess... //Emote none Happy

Option2:: You have such fair skin. How do you keep from getting sunburns?


Response1:: You really have been busy! We both have, really. Perhaps we could take it slow for a night and spend some time together? Like... a date? //Emote none Happy

Response2:: I used to get sunburns all the time, but now Catherine gives me a homemade sunblock. It works remarkably well!


Option1a:: I don't think that's a good idea. //Relationship Lucia9 -1 sad

Option1b:: I would love that! //Quest none LuciaHangout2Quest

Response1a:: Oh dear, my apologies XX. I must have simply misread things between us. //Emote none Sad

Response1b:: Fantastic! Meet me outside of my house tomorrow night at 5:00 pm. I can't wait, XX!


Option2a:: I assumed it was because of your magic.

Option2b:: Are you saying that Catherine's magic is as strong as yours?

Response2a:: Not everything I do is done magically, you know. Although, Catherine's salves certainly work like magic!

Response2b:: Actually XX, I'm talking about her herbalism practice and not her witchcraft. She makes many helpful potions without relying on any spells! She's quite remarkable.
