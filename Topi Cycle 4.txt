Topi Cycle 4

Dialogue:: You're lucky you get to play on a farm all day!


Option1:: You know that what I do is hard work, right?

Option2:: You get to play all day too, right?


Response1:: Sure, but it's fun because you get to play in dirt and mud and stuff too. Right?

Response2:: It's not the same. When I get too dirty then I get in trouble with my mom.


Option1a:: I try not to get too dirty. //Relationship Topi4 -1

Option1b:: That's right, farming is a lot of fun! //Relationship Topi4 2

Response1a:: Figures, adults are always so boring.

Response1b:: I knew it! I want to be a farmer too now, just like you, XX.


Option2a:: Your dad doesn't care?

Option2b:: Just clean up before your mom gets home.

Response2a:: He's usually dirty too, hehehe.

Response2b:: Ooh, that sounds like something Pod would say. You're real smart, XX!
