Iris Cycle 13

Dialogue:: Hi, XX. Today I saw a flower bud that made me think of you. It just started to bloom!

Option1:: Is that because I'm... pretty like a flower?

Option2:: You're so charming. I've never met anyone like you before, Iris.


Response1:: Maybe! Or maybe it's because you're soft and gentle. With me, at least. Also, you smell surprisingly nice!

Response2:: Like me, huh? Well, I can't <i>not</i> dig into that a little bit. Please, explain!


Option1a:: I'm not soft - I'm tough. //Relationship Iris13 -1

Option1b:: I'm liking this flower bud image more and more. //Relationship Iris13 2 Happy

Response1a:: Alright, relax. You're not fooling anyone with the tough act.

Response1b:: Haha, you're such a dork. I mean it about the smell, though. You should smell like mud and sweat, but you just smell... really good! 


Option2a:: You're brilliant and intensely focused. //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: You're gorgeous and totally independent. //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: Heh, thanks, XX![]We're already dating, but it feels like you're getting ready to ask me out again... What are you planning?

Response2b:: Heh, thanks, XX![]We're already dating, but it feels like you're getting ready to ask me out again... What are you planning?
