Dialogue:: Hey there, XX! Sorry again about the rough landing you had here in Sun Haven. You got any crops growing yet?

Option1:: So you're in charge of all the soldiers in Sun Haven?

Option2:: With everything that's happened, is Sun Haven in any danger?


Response1:: Yes indeed, I'm captain of the guard. The Sun Haven Corps includes some of the finest soldiers I've seen! In truth, I'm honored to lead them.

Response2:: At the moment? No, not at all. The Great Army has established a military outpost in Sun Haven for a time like this. We're here to keep an eye on things and ensure that the town's borders remain secure.


Option1a:: What makes them stand out from other soldiers? //Emote none Happy

Option1b:: You care for them quite a bit.

Response1a:: You won't find soldiers with more spirit than those under my command. Even if there isn't usually a lot of fighting to do here, they manage to keep their chins up. //Emote none Happy

Response1b:: Of course! They're in my charge, which means I'm responsible for turning them into the strongest soldiers possible. That's a responsibility I don't take lightly.


Option2a:: It's comforting to have you here. //Relationship Nathaniel1 2 Happy

Option2b:: Somehow, that makes me feel less safe. //Relationship Nathaniel1 -1 Sad

Response2a:: I'm happy we're here, too. Sun Haven is a gem of a city. Even with everything we're facing, I'm glad to protect it. //Emote none Happy

Response2b:: What, really? I don't see why.
