Catherine Cycle 7

Dialogue:: Sorry if I seem a little off. My aura is pinker than usual today.

Option1:: Are you seeing anybody?

Option2:: Catherine... I was hoping to ask you on a date. //Emote none Romantic


Response1:: Oh no, nothing romantic like that. I have plenty of friends, but just friends. I haven't had many romances in town, actually.

Response2:: You were hoping to? Well... I hope you do too! Now would be a good time, if you're going to ask.


Option1a:: That's surprising to hear... //Relationship Catherine7 2 Romantic

Option1b:: Well that's unsurprising. //Relationship Catherine7 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Oh, surprising huh? XX, it almost sounds like you were hoping for that answer!

Response1b:: Oh, I didn't realize I was so undesirable to you. Good to know, XX.


Option2a:: Actually, I better not.

Option2b:: Let's go on a date together! //Quest none CatherineHangout1Quest

Response2a:: Oh, no? Well, all right XX. I'm just as happy to be your friend.

Response2b:: Oh my, what a surprise! Hehe, of course I'll go out with you XX! Meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm.
