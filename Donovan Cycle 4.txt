Donovan Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Hey XX! I'm glad to see you, I was getting pretty bored.

Option1:: Are you just talking to me because you're bored, or because you like me?

Option2:: If you're bored, tell me the wildest thing that happened to you last week.


Response1:: That's a hard question, XX. On the one hand, I'm very bored. On the other, I actually do like you for some reason. I guess I just don't know how to answer the question.

Response2:: Last week... Oh, you've heard of Elementals? People made of fire or ice or whatever? I was sitting on a rock taking a rest and... Yep, it was an Elemental.[]This lady was not happy to wake up under my butt, let me tell you. She threw me so far, I landed in a harpy's nest halfway up a tree.[]The upside? Harpy omelettes for breakfast the next day!


Option1a:: What do you mean, "for some reason?" //Emote none Embarrassed

Option1b:: Sounds like you're avoiding the question... //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1a:: Don't take it the wrong way - I just mean that I usually don't hang around the same people for too long. But I like chatting it up with you.

Response1b:: Don't take it the wrong way - I just mean that I usually don't hang around the same people for too long. But I like chatting it up with you.


Option2a:: There's no way that's all true. //Relationship Donovan4 -1 Mad

Option2b:: Harpy's eggs? I've never had them, but I'll try anything. //Relationship Donovan4 2 Happy

Response2a:: Believe it or not, I don't care. I know what happened.

Response2b:: That's the right kind of attitude! Heck, I'll even make you an omelette someday.
