Tornn Cycle 1

Dialogue:: I remember you, you're XX. Did you come looking for a cape, or just some conversation?


Option1:: Do you make the capes yourself?

Option2:: Have you always been a cape salesman?


Response1:: From the finest silk I can forage, that's right. Of course, I'm careful to make sure any spider webs are empty before I collect them. I don't want to steal anybody's home.

Response2:: I used to do some jobs with Rel'Tar, but we've retired from that work now. I much prefer the peace and quiet of Nel'Vari to the action that goes on outside of the forest here.


Option1a:: You really care about the forest. //Relationship Tornn1 2

Option1b:: They're just spiders. //Relationship Tornn1 -1

Response1a:: Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain, just like everything else. That might seem thoughtful to you, but for Elves it's a simple fact of life.

Response1b:: That shows how much you care about the forest, then. Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain.


Option2a:: Who were the jobs for?

Option2b:: It sounds like you were doing dangerous work.

Response2a:: We charged a hefty sum for our skills, since the work was often dangerous. So we were mostly hired by officials from other cities, since they were the only ones who could afford us.[]I can tell you're curious, so I'll say right up front that I don't care to dwell on those times. But I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people. 

Response2b:: You're right about the work being dangerous, but I really don't care to dwell on those times.[]I can tell you're curious. I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people.
