Beeanca Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Breathtaking day today, isn't it? But then, aren't they all breathtaking in Nel'Vari?

Option1:: So... are you an Amari?
Option2:: You're like a queen bee!

Response1:: Of course I'm an Amari! Goodness, what a silly question. Bee Amari like me are quite rare, and are more naturally in tune with our animal cousins. Look at how these bees just follow me wherever I go![]Aren't we just absolutely fa-bee-lous?
Response2:: Oh, honey, I am <i>the</i>  queen bee! There's no other bee quite like me, understand? No one matches my hustle, my style or my charms! Nel'Vari is lucky to have me, really.

Option1a:: Yes, you are! //Relationship Beeanca2 2
Option1b:: That's an awfully shoehorned pun, lady. //Relationship Beeanca2 -1

Response1a:: Exactly!
Response1b:: Buzz off. They can't all <i>bee</i>  winners.

Option2a:: Is there a king bee?
Option2b:: Do you live in a hive?

Response2a:: Trying to flirt with me? Cute. But I'm far too busy for dating right now.
Response2b:: Um. No. A hive would be much too small for me. I live in a giant magically-enhanced tree stump, like a <i>normal</i>  person.
