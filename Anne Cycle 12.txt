Anne Cycle 12

Dialogue:: I've been hearing a lot of talk lately. I think people know about us!

Option1:: Does that worry you? I thought you weren't afraid of anything!

Option2:: I've never been so popular! //Emote none Happy


Response1:: What am I, some kind of action novel hero? Of course I have fears, XX. I'm just a person. But I'm not afraid of talk. Talk is just talk.

Response2:: No? First time for everything, I guess![]I'm used to this kind of attention, but that shouldn't surprise you. Getting people to talk about me is part of my business plan, after all.


Option1a:: Will you tell me what scares you, then? //Relationship Anne12 2

Option1b:: And here I thought you lived fearlessly. //Relationship Anne12 -1

Response1a:: Alright, sure. Part of me will always be afraid of losing everything, going broke, and living on the streets again. Also... crabs kind of freak me out.[]Have you noticed that I stay away from Peter? Now you know why. I can't believe he lives with that sea bug on his head!

Response1b:: You're being weird, XX. I'm just a normal person like anyone else. Except more successful and attractive.


Option2a:: You've always got a plan, huh?

Option2b:: Is the attention tiring?

Response2a:: Well, not always. To tell you the truth, a lot of the time I'm just making it up as I go. I just do well when the pressure is on! I bet you know what that's like, too.

Response2b:: Yes, in a way, but it's something I've lived with for years now. It's not going anywhere, and I refuse to let it run me down.[]It feels good to talk about it a bit. I haven't had the chance to do that very much before you.
