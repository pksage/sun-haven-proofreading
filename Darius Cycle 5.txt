Darius Cycle 5

Dialogue:: Hello again, XX.

Option1:: Wait, did you actually call me by my name?

Option2:: I want to contribute to Withergate's prosperity, my prince. 


Response1:: Don't push it. You're walking a razor-thin line right now. Make wise decisions.

Response2:: Are you suggesting that Withergate needs the help of an outsider?


Option1a:: Does this mean I can call you Darius? //Relationship Darius5 -1 Mad

Option1b:: I'm honored, Prince Darius. //Relationship Darius5 2

Response1a:: That's pushing it. You're still an outsider.

Response1b:: I'm glad that my investment in you hasn't been a complete waste of time.


Option2a:: Not at all, my prince. I only want to help if I can.

Option2b:: Everyone needs help, sometimes. //Emote none Mad

Response2a:: If you wish to join the higher levels of our society, you must learn not to degrade yourself like this.

Response2b:: Your Human town might call for aid when things get rough, but Withergate succeeds on its own. You have nothing to offer us.
