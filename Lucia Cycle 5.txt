Lucia Cycle 5

Dialogue:: I've heard people calling you farmer a lot. Do you like that? I think it's endearing!

Option1:: Do you have any nicknames?

Option2:: The people here really are nice.


Response1:: Well... All right, XX. I'll tell you this because I'm starting to really trust you. But please don't repeat this![]My grandfather called me "cinderhead" when I was a child. Usually when I was getting up to mischief. And - just between us, XX! - I still call myself cinderhead sometimes.

Response2:: The citizens are my favorite thing about Sun Haven. They make this town what it is. Without them, I would have no purpose here. What's a leader without people behind her?


Option1a:: What if I started calling you cinderhead? //Relationship Lucia5a 2 Happy

Option1b:: I promise I'll keep your nickname a secret! 

Response1a:: I'm afraid that would necessitate a hostile response...[]I'm joking, XX! Though the look on your face was certainly satisfying.

Response1b:: I believe you, XX. I don't know why, but I felt a sense of trust in you the moment we met.


Option2a:: I'd like to get to know the people better. //Relationship Lucia5b 2 Happy

Option2b:: A leader should be able to stand alone. //Relationship Lucia5b -1 Mad

Response2a:: Oh, good![]Perhaps try to strike up conversations with more of your neighbors. Getting to know people is the best way to find one's place in a new community.

Response2b:: I don't mean to offend you, XX, but that is a truly ignorant statement. It's clear you've never been in a position of leadership.
