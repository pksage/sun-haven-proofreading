Iris Cycle P10

Dialogue:: I've been wondering lately, what is life outside of Nel'Vari like? In the lands and cities beyond.

Option1:: What has you wondering about the world outside Nel'Vari?
Option2:: It varies widely, depending on where you go.

Response1:: I've lived in Nel'Vari for a very long time. I know how everything works here. How the people go about their days, and the powers that make our society tick.[]I might be an enchantress, but I've given everything around here at least a cursory try before.[]But what's it like outside of Nel'Vari? What sort of fundamental power turns the wheels in places like Sun Haven?
Response2:: The power of enchanting has so deeply altered how we are able to live and work in Nel'Vari. It's strange but fun to sometimes imagine how we'd get by without it.[]I would never want to leave Nel'Vari, but it does makes me wonder... Would I still be the same Iris if I were born in Sun Haven?

Option1a:: I'd love to tell you all about it sometime. //Relationship IrisP10 2 Happy
Option1b:: Go out and see for yourself sometime! //Relationship IrisP10 -1 Mad

Response1a:: It would be incredibly interesting to hear. Thank you for understanding my curiosity, and thank you even more for offering to sate it.
Response1b:: No thanks, XX. You should I know prefer to stay relatively close to Nel'Vari. I just wanted to ask you a question, I didn't expect you to try pushing me like this.

Option2a:: You would always be you, no matter what.  //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: If you weren't born in Nel'Vari you'd be a totally different person. 

Response2a:: Hmm, you really believe so? That's also an interesting thought! Iris the Human, experimenting on... cows, or... rocks. Or whatever it is they use over there.
Response2b:: That's such a tough thing to think, even if you might be right. I don't <i>want</i> to ever be different. I want to be Iris! Maybe I should stop thinking about the outside world.
