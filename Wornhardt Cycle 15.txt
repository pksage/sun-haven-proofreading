Wornhardt Cycle 15

Dialogue:: Your smile is bright as the sun, XX. I hope your day has been good so far!

Option1:: I only smile like this when I see you!
Option2:: Are you happy in our relationship, Wornhardt?  //Emote none Romantic

Response1:: You're such a cheeseball! I've actually heard of studies done on smiles. The idea is that people who smile more are healthier and live longer.
Response2:: Am I... XX, I'm the happiest I've been! If we were stuck together for the rest of our lives, it wouldn't be long enough![]Oh, heh. I didn't mean to suggest anything by that...

Option1a:: If that's true, then we're going to live a looong time. //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: That doesn't sound very scientific.

Response1a:: I'll have to make sure you get your daily dose!
Response1b:: Maybe not. I honestly can't vouch for the credibility of the study, but it's a fun thought anyway.[]Can you imagine if I wrote a prescription for smiles?

Option2a:: I could spend the rest of my life with you, too. //Relationship Wornhardt15 2 Happy
Option2b:: It's difficult for me to picture anything lasting that long... //Relationship Wornhardt15 -1 Sad

Response2a:: I don't mean to ruin the moment, but we are talking about marriage, right? Sometimes I can be a bit oblivious to social cues, heh.[]In any case, I'm ready whenever you're ready.
Response2b:: Oh, sure, I see. Maybe you're not ready to take that step, XX - and that's fine. But whenever you are... I'll be here.
