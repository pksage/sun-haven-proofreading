Vaan Cycle 18

Dialogue:: I spoke with Nivara today. It was the first time in a long while.

Option1:: You haven't been speaking to her as much?  //Emote none Sad
Option2:: What did you talk about?

Response1:: No, I haven't. I actually didn't realize how long it's been since our last conversation. Do you think that's a bad thing?
Response2:: She said that my spirit feels stronger than the last time we met. Before I could even respond to that, she said she could feel an abundance of love in my energy.[]According to Nivara, knowing love is crucial to spiritual freedom. I'm still exploring that idea.

Option1a:: Isn't that like skipping school?
Option1b:: Don't you think she still has much to teach?

Response1a:: She certainly has a few lessons left for me, probably more than I realize. You're right, XX. I'll make a better effort to see her more often.
Response1b:: She certainly has a few lessons left for me, probably more than I realize. You're right, XX. I'll make a better effort to see her more often.

Option2a:: Let me know if you need any help testing that idea! //Relationship Vaan18 2 Happy
Option2b:: Do you really think she could sense that? //Relationship Vaan18 -1

Response2a:: Heh. Oh, XX. I'm already getting all the "help" I need from you.[]I should thank you, actually. I didn't realize it, but you've accelerated my spiritual growth here. And just by being yourself! You're truly remarkable, XX.
Response2b:: Of course, XX. It's not our place to doubt the Guardian Dragons, especially not Nivara. I'm sure you wouldn't cast doubt on Elios.
