Dialogue:: Working hard, farmer? I suppose you'd have to, huh?


Option1:: What do you do for work?

Option2:: You're right, farming is hard work.


Response1:: I rent a room out to travelers. Business has been down lately, as you can imagine.

Response2:: Don't I know it. That's why I never bothered with farming.


Option1a:: Why wouldn't your customers just stay at the inn above the tavern? 

Option1b:: That's a smart business model. 

Response1a:: People are happy to pay for a private space. The inn can get pretty raucous on a busy night.

Response2a:: A good friend told me to work smart, not hard. That thinking has kept me very comfortable here.
