Calvin Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Is it boring working on a farm? It must be more fun than standing in one spot all day.


Option1:: You're the most bored person I've ever met.

Option2:: Running a farm is a lot of work.


Response1:: Oh yeah? That's kind of a compliment. Kind of.

Response2:: I'm up for a challenge. What do you say, need a farmhand?


Option1a:: I don't see how it's a compliment.

Option1b:: You're a strange one, Calvin.

Response1a:: Well, I've never been the "most" anything before. At this point, I'll take what I can get.

Response1b:: Strange times make strange people. Isn't that the saying?


Option2a:: I'll let you know if I do. //Relationship Calvin2 1

Option2b:: Definitely not. //Relationship Calvin2 -1

Response2a:: Really? I was just joking, but if you offered me a job I might actually be tempted to take it.

Response2b:: You could just say "no."
