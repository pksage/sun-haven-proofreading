Anne Cycle 3

Dialogue:: I knew you'd be back, XX. Something I can help you with?


Option1:: You have good taste, right? What's your favorite food?

Option2:: I was just wondering, have you gone to see Elios?


Response1:: When I asked what I could do for you, I meant in terms of merchandise, but...[]Are we talking favorite food of all time? Then I have to go with raspberry cheesecake. So creamy and rich! How can anyone say no to that?

Response2:: I went to see the Sun Dragon on my fourth day in town. It was mostly for publicity though - don't want to snub the local traditions, right?[]Anyway, I'm not Blessed like Lucia. Who needs magic when you've got a steady income?


Option1a:: Good to know.

Option1b:: Do you think I should try it?

Response1a:: I don't like that look on your face. Let me just say that whatever you're up to, it's not going to work and it better involve raspberry cheesecake.

Response1b:: You haven't had it before? XX, that's completely unacceptable! Go to Liam's bakery and grab a piece immediately! ... And bring me a piece too!


Option2a:: Pretending to value a town's tradition is worse than not participating in it at all. //Relationship Anne3 -1 Mad

Option2b:: You seem so strategic, no wonder you're such a success. //Relationship Anne3 2 Happy

Response2a:: You're right, how dare I receive the Sun Dragon's blessing and make an honest living for myself! I'm so ashamed...[]... I hope you can tell that I'm being sarcastic.

Response2b:: Ooh, surprise flattery! Be careful XX, you're starting to grow on me.
