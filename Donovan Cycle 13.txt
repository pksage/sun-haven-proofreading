Donovan Cycle 13

Dialogue:: How long have we been together now? I'm already forgetting what it was like being without you!

Option1:: We've both changed a lot. Just wait until I get you eating healthy.

Option2:: Do you miss running around without any attachments?


Response1:: I don't really know what eating "healthy" means, but I always feel good after eating a lot of meat. I especially love a big steak.[]If it makes me feel good, that's got to mean it's healthy. Right?

Response2:: If you're asking whether or not I miss being single - without you - then it's a big fat NO. Sometimes I think about running off somewhere, but that's just animal instinct.[]When it comes down to it, I really love being with you, XX.


Option1a:: You know you need vegetables too, right? //Emote none Embarrassed

Option1b:: That's... not right. But I can help you with your diet!

Response1a:: ... Why would you say something like that? Don't even joke, XX.

Response1b:: Hm... All right, I trust you. But I won't stop eating meat! I need it. For my soul, which is in my stomach.


Option2a:: Good, because I don't like the idea of you running around who-knows-where. //Relationship Donovan13 -1 Sad

Option2b:: If you ever feel the need to run off somewhere, don't stop on my account. //Relationship Donovan13 2 Happy

Response2a:: Whoa, slow down XX. I'm not going to stop my outings just because we're together. That would change who I am entirely, which is just not going to happen.

Response2b:: And that's why you're the only one for me, XX. You let me be myself. But part of being a wolf is having a pack, and it feels really good to have one now.
