Wornhardt Cycle 7

Dialogue:: Hello there, farmer. Do you hear the birds today? There are so many songs to listen to![]Anyway, what's on your mind?

Option1:: Are you seeing anybody in town, Wornhardt?

Option2:: Wornhardt, I want to ask you... on a date!


Response1:: Me? Oh, no. I mean, some people have certainly caught my eye, but I don't really put myself "out there", if you know what I mean.

Response2:: Oh! Haha, that's the last thing I was expecting! It sounds fun to me, I guess I'm just a little surprised that you're interested.


Option1a:: You know, you could change that whenever you want! //Relationship Wornhardt7 2 Happy

Option1b:: You don't seem like the type of person to do that. //Relationship Wornhardt7 -1 Sad

Response1a:: Oh! Really, you think? I guess I am a doctor, after all. Who knows, maybe now is the right time for me to get "out there."

Response1b:: I'm... not sure how to take that?


Option2a:: So what do you say? //Quest none WornhardtHangout1Quest

Option2b:: Maybe it's not the best idea after all.

Response2a:: XX, of course I'd like to go out with you! Why don't we meet out front of the hospital at 10:00 am tomorrow?

Response2b:: Oh no? Hm, that's disappointing. But I'm glad you thought it through.
