Dialogue:: Hey farmer, how's my breath? Hm, you didn't even flinch. No, this won't work.


Option1:: What are you talking about?

Option2(Permanent):: How can I help?


Response1:: I'm trying to make my breath smell bad. It's to keep people from talking to me at the tavern. I've been getting a lot of unwelcome attention lately, so I thought up this clever little plan!

Response2:: Well obviously my breath isn't stinky enough. Can you cook me a meal with fish? <color=#39CCFF>Fish Tempura</color> should do the trick.


Option2a:: Okay, I'm on it. //Quest none HelpfulHalitosisQuest

Option2b:: I'm too busy right now.


Response2a:: Great, get that back to me in a hurry! I'll pay you, of course. (End)

Response2b:: Fine then. Maybe I'll muster up the courage to ask Peter... (End)
