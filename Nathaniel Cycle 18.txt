Dialogue:: My lovely XX, you're exactly who I need to see right now.

Option1:: Rough day?
Option2:: How can I help?

Response1:: Just tiring. We're anticipating a shipment of supplies, so we have to take a full inventory of the barracks. It's exhausting.
Response2:: I could use a pick-me-up. You always have something sweet to say!

Option1a:: Don't let a little counting ruin your day.
Option1b:: Don't work yourself too hard today.

Response1a:: I know, and I won't, but sometimes I have to put on a face for the other soldiers. Today is definitely one of those days.
Response1b:: I know, and I won't, but sometimes I have to put on a face for the other soldiers. Today is definitely one of those days.

Option2a:: I guess your hair looks nice today. //Relationship Nathaniel18 -1 Sad
Option2b:: If I'm sweet, it's just because I've spent so much time with you. //Relationship Nathaniel18 2 Happy

Response2a:: That's not quite the sweetness I was hoping for, but I'll take what I can get I guess.
Response2b:: See that? That's <i>exactly</i> what I needed. XX, thank you for being so... you!
