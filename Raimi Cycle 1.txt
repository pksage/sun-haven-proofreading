Raimi Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Hey, new neighbor, I want you to know that I've got your back!


Option1:: Do you always carry a bow with you?

Option2:: What do you do here, Raimi?


Response1:: Of course! I have to be prepared, you know. Not everyone in this town knows their way around a weapon, so it will be up to us leaders to protect them in an emergency.

Response2:: I'm a hunter, so I'm always out in the wilderness. You have to watch your back out there or something nasty might sneak up on you.


Option1a:: What kind of emergency are you expecting?

Option1b:: Don't you think the guards have it under control?

Response1a:: I'm not expecting any one emergency, but I'm prepared for all emergencies.

Response1b:: These guards spend all day lounging in the sunshine. They aren't on my level.


Option2a:: If animals are sneaking up on you, you're probably not a great hunter. //Relationship Raimi1 -1

Option2b:: Sounds tricky, you must be very skilled. //Relationship Raimi1 2

Response2a:: Whoa, unexpectedly harsh for a farmer.

Response2b:: You're sharp! My skills are unmatched.
