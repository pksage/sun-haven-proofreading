Iris Cycle 5

Dialogue:: I never told you, I think it's really impressive how you found your way into NelVari!

Option1:: Have you been outside of Nel'Vari much?

Option2:: How do you feel about Nel'Vari being so secretive?


Response1:: Mostly just to gather different kinds of plants. I don't like to stray too far, though. The farther I get from Nel'Vari, the more I worry. I can't explain it exactly, but it feels like being exposed.

Response2:: I think it's a bit much, honestly. But the Elder can tell you stories of intruders from the past. I guess our culture came close to being wiped out, once.[]It's frightening stuff, so I understand why we take precautions now.


Option1a:: The world is a big place, it can be intimidating. //Relationship Iris5 2

Option1b:: That's silly, you should explore the world. //Relationship Iris5 -1 Sad

Response1a:: It's something like that, yeah. It's nice that you understand - even if I don't fully understand myself.

Response1b:: I don't think it's silly at all. I'm happy here, so why leave?


Option2a:: Do you worry about that happening again?

Option2b:: With that in mind, it makes sense that you would hide yourselves. //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: No, I'm not worried. It's not worth the risk to our society to <i>not</i> have the protection spell in place.

Response2b:: I came to the same realization when the Elder told me what happened.[]You're really starting to see things like a Nel'Vari Elf! I'm glad the Elder welcomed you into our home.
