Benny Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Another fan coming to see Withergate's finest busker? Sorry kid, I don't do autographs!

Option1:: Do you have a lot of fans?
Option2:: What's a busker?

Response1:: Well, no. Not yet! I will soon, though. I've got all the time in the world to build my fanbase!
Response2:: Huh? You mean you aren't a busker-buff? Hmph, that's a slap in the ego...[]A busker is a street performer, obviously!

Option1a:: That will never happen. //Relationship Benny1 -1
Option1b:: I bet you already have more fans than you know! //Relationship Benny1 2

Response1a:: Not with that attitude... Besides, since I'm a ghost I can wait forever and ever to reach my success!
Response1b:: Is that right? Have you heard something?? This is it - Busker Benny is finally on his way to the big time!! 

Option2a:: You seem proud to be a busker.
Option2b:: Is it a fun job?

Response2a:: It's not just a job, you know. It's my whole reason for being here! Sure, I could float off to the afterlife if I wanted to - <i>yawn!</i>[]I still need to make a name for myself here before I move on. Soon, everyone will know Benny as the best busker in Withergate!
