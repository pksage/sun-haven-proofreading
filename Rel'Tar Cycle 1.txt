Rel'Tar Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Welcome back, traveler. Enjoying the fruits of Nel'Vari? Or is this about business?


Option1:: Where did you learn to make crossbows?

Option2:: What's the best crossbow you've got?


Response1:: I've been making crossbows since I was a young boy. Back then, they were hardly more than sticks and twine, but I assure you I've improved my craft.

Response2:: That's my Mark, easily. I call it that because it hasn't missed a target yet. It's more of a relic now, though. Haven't needed to use that one in some time.


Option1a:: I can see that - I can't wait to try one out! //Relationship Rel'Tar1 2

Option1b:: I'll believe it when I see it. //Relationship Rel'Tar1 -1

Response1a:: Heh, I see you appreciate quality gear. That makes sense for a traveler. And yet, you strike me as more than the average adventuring type.[]Anyway, I'm happy to help you however I can. Maybe one day you can help me out, too.

Response1b:: Alright, don't take me at my word, then. The evidence is right in front of you.


Option2a:: What do you mean by that?

Option2b:: You don't use it anymore?

Response2a:: I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.[]Heck, most people knew of "Rel'Tar's Mark" before they even knew me!

Response2b:: I only use the Mark when necessary. I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.[]Heck, most people knew of "Rel'Tar's Mark" before they even knew me!
