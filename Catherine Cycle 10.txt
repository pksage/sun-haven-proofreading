Dialogue:: XX! I've been looking for you. Here, I brought you something to keep you strong.

Option2:: I was wondering... Did you put a romance spell on me??


Response1:: Why thank you, XX! I know the best herbal remedies for healthy, vibrant hair. There's no magic involved at all!

Response2:: Oh? You're just now thinking of this? Hm... Did I... Did I... I guess you'll never know!

Option1b:: I don't believe that for a second. //Relationship Catherine10 -1 Mad


Response1a:: Start believing XX, because it's true. If you stop by my house sometime, I could even show you my formula!

Response1b:: I can't tell if you're joking or... okay, you're serious. Wow, XX. Come on, I'm no liar.


Option2a:: Wait, I was only joking...

Option2b:: Now it sounds like you actually did!


Response2a:: Oh come on, XX. Of course I didn't! If you're feeling any kind of romance, then that's coming from you - and you can't blame me for that.

Response2b:: Oh come on, XX. Of course I didn't! If you're feeling any kind of romance, then that's coming from you - and you can't blame me for that.
