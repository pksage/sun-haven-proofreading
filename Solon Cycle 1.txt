Solon Cycle 1

Dialogue:: Farmer.


Option1:: How did you become a master blacksmith?

Option2:: You have a reputation as a tough teacher.


Response1:: A lifetime of putting iron to the forge will do that.[]Anyway, can't be any kind of blacksmith before you've got an anvil. Have you made yourself one?

Response2:: You're darn right I do. You don't learn discipline by being coddled.


Option1a:: Of course I have. 

Option1b:: Of course I have... not.

Response1a:: Then you're ready to make your own gear, which means you need ore. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, put that pickaxe I gave you to work.

Response1b:: You'll need ore to craft one. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, grab yourself a pickaxe and put it to good use.


Option2a:: Hard work is the best teacher there is. //Relationship Solon1 2

Option2b:: What if you tried a more positive teaching strategy? //Relationship Solon1 -1

Response2a:: That's right. Sounds like the farm fell into capable hands. 

Response2b:: More positive? The only thing I'm positive about is this - you're a total ninny.
