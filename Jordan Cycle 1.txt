Dialogue:: Hey, the farmer is back! Heh, good to see you, XX. What can I do for you?


Option1:: Are you close with Liam?

Option2:: What do you like to do around here?


Response1:: Yeah, I'd say so. Jun introduced us not long after Liam came into town. He recommended that I start working here to take some pressure off Liam, so I did!

Response2:: Well, I mostly clean and bake and handle sales... Oh wait, you mean in Sun Haven![]I like to go to the library and the record store. I try to keep some creativity in my life, even if it's just from a new song.


Option1a:: So you're just coworkers?

Option1b:: You must know his sisters well, too.

Response1a:: Oh no, Liam is a good friend. I just happen to work for him, too. He doesn't make it feel like that, though. Liam always keeps it friendly. He's a great boss, really!

Response1b:: Oh yeah, Emma and Elizabeth come running through here all the time. They'll talk to me about school or what pictures they're drawing.[]They're some of the cutest kids I've seen!


Option2a:: You must get creative here, too. //Relationship Jordan1 2

Option2b:: Listening to music isn't really creative. //Relationship Jordan1 -1

Response2a:: Sure, when I can. I'm not as skilled an artist as Liam, but I don't need to be the best. I just try to enjoy myself.

Response2b:: I get what you mean, since I'm not actually making the music, but even just listening to music can be a creative exercise for your brain. You should give it a try, seems like you need it.
