Kitty Cycle P15

Dialogue:: XX, listen listen! Last night I had a dream that was the most strangest dream ever. I wasn't Kitty at all, but a Human!

Option1:: A Human? That is weird. //Emote none Sad
Option2:: Do you have many dreams like that?

Response1:: It felt so strange! No claws, no reflexes, no smells. I don't know how Humans live every day like that, nyaan!
Response2:: Not so many like that, nya. I do have dreams though! My favorite is when I'm flying in the air, and then I catch the birdies right out of the sky!

Option1a:: Was there anything about it that you liked?
Option1b:: At least it was only for a night!

Response1a:: Well, my ears didn't itch so much. Did you know my ears get so so itchy all the time, nya? When the wind messes up my fur, it itches - itchy itchy!
Response1b:: True true! If Kitty had to be that way all the time... I don't even like to think about it, nyan!

Option2a:: That sounds like fun! //Relationship KittyP15 2 Happy
Option2b:: Poor birds! //Relationship KittyP15 -1 Sad

Response2a:: The next time you dream about flying, you should try to catch a birdie too! Then tell Kitty aaaallll about it, nya!
Response2b:: Nyan? They're not real, silly XX.[]Kitty doesn't hurt animals in real life. Except maybe fish for dinner...
