Dialogue:: Heya, what can I help you with?


Option1:: Is it busy on the orchard?

Option2:: So about the monkeys...

Response1:: Is it ever! We grow and make all sorts of things here. There's never much time to relax, but that's okay. We'd all rather be busy!

Response2:: Oh, them? Don't give them any worry! They're not like the chimchucks you find out in the wilderness, hehe. I wouldn't call them "tame", exactly, but they're pretty friendly.[]They're willing to help with the harvest in exchange for some fruit!


Option1a:: Your productivity is amazing!

Option1b:: You should slow down once in a while.

Response1a:: Heya, thanks! It's good to have our hard work appreciated. //Relationship Erica1 1

Response1b:: Nope!  //Relationship Erica1 -1


Option2a:: That's fascinating.

Option2b:: Are you sure you can trust them?

Response2a:: Aw, I agree! They really <i>are</i> some fascinating critters!

Response2b:: They've never caused any trouble before. The way I see it, there's no reason to not trust them.
