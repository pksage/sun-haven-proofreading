Donovan Cycle 18

Dialogue:: You wanna hear something weird? I haven't felt bored in... well, the longest time ever!

Option1:: What have you been doing to keep from getting bored?
Option2:: Why is that so weird, anyway?

Response1:: I can't really explain it, but I haven't been doing anything different at all. Even if I'm at home alone for a few hours, I'm just... relaxed?[]Ugh, I'm starting to bore myself now.
Response2:: I always thought boredom was like failing yourself. I mean, if I can't even keep <i>myself</i> interested then how am I supposed to be interesting to other people?

Option1a:: You're becoming a boring person! //Relationship Donovan18 -1 Mad
Option1b:: Maybe you're just more content now. //Relationship Donovan18 2 Happy

Response1a:: No way! I would sniff the Moon Dragon's <i>butt</i> before I let that happen!
Response1b:: Content, huh? Eh, I guess. Sounds a little too similar to "boring" but maybe it's not as bad.[]Who knows? This could be a turning point for me! 

Option2a:: You're always interesting to me, Donovan. //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: You worry too much about how other people see you. //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: You've got a point. If I can keep you interested, then who cares about anyone else?[]Oh, except Arianella. I need her to like me so she'll teach me how to sew. I tear holes in a lot of my clothes... 
Response2b:: You've got a point. If I can keep you interested, then who cares about anyone else?[]Oh, except Arianella. I need her to like me so she'll teach me how to sew. I tear holes in a lot of my clothes...
