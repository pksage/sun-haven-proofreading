Darius Cycle 8

Dialogue:: XX, I'm glad you're here. My mind could use a distraction.

Option1:: Why not head to the carnival if you need a distraction?

Option2:: Darius, as the prince of Withergate... are you dating anyone? //Emote none Embarrassed


Response1:: Because I have no capacity for childish games... but, at least the citizens enjoy it.[]Xyla suggested it would raise spirits here. Monsterfolk are a downtrodden people, so my father made the call.[]In actuality, I would prefer to have barracks and barracks of fighters to protect our city. Maybe we will, one day.

Response2:: Oh? Heh, that caught me off guard. I never know what to expect from you, XX.[]In fact, I have no romantic involvement right now. I'm very much open to the idea, though.


Option1a:: Increasing your strength is always a good idea. //Relationship Darius8 2 Happy

Option1b:: Security is important, but so is having fun. //Relationship Darius8 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Certainly. It would secure the future of my family, as well as all monsterfolk. Your support is more than welcome.

Response1b:: Of course you think so. You're still an outsider, completely ignorant of my people's history.


Option2a:: I'm surprised you don't already have someone at your side.

Option2b:: I'm sure you will find someone soon! //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: My father has tried to arrange my relationships before, but that never ended well. I much prefer to make those decisions on my own.

Response2b:: Oh? Do you know something I don't? I'm keeping my eye on you, XX.
