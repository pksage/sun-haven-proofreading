Giuseppe Cycle 5

Dialogue:: Gotten to know everyone yet? We're not the biggest town on the map, but we sure do have spirit.

Option1:: You're one of the most spirited people in town, Giuseppe.
Option2:: What do you want Topi to be when he grows up?

Response1:: Aw gee, you think? Heh, thanks farmer! It's not often I get a compliment out of the blue.[]I try to stay positive. If ever I'm feeling down, I just channel that into my art.
Response2:: I don't want him to be anything, specifically. It's up to him to figure that stuff out. As long as he does what he loves and supports his family, I'd be proud.

Option1a:: That sounds unhealthy.
Option1b:: That explains a lot about you.

Response1a:: Huh? But Jun told me it was a good practice. Maybe I should check in with that guy.
Response1b:: Oh, don't get the wrong idea! Not <i>all</i> of my art comes from a dark place. Making art is more like a kind of meditation that calms me down. That's how Jun explained it to me, anyway.

Option2a:: Do you support your family? //Relationship Giuseppe5 -1
Option2b:: You're a good role model for him, then. //Relationship Giuseppe5 2

Response2a:: Alright, let me rephrase it: so long as he does what he loves and at least marries someone who supports a family, I'd be proud.[]I just want to be a grandpa one day!
Response2b:: Sure! Except for the, um, "support the family" part, since Tonya brings in all the money.[]If Topi is lucky enough to find someone who will support his dreams like Tonya does for me, then I'd be proud too. Really, I just want to be a grandpa one day!
