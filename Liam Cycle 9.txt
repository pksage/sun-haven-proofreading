Liam Cycle 9

Dialogue:: XX, glad to see you. I don't need anything, or anything like that. I mean, it's just nice seeing you is all.[]Er, do you have a question for me? You look like you have a question for me.

Option1:: I was wondering, do you like to read much? //Emote none Happy

Option2:: What's more important to you, being rich or being happy?


Response1:: Sure! At least, I think I still do. I haven't finished a book in a long time.

Response2:: Well, being happy is always most important. But it's a lot easier being happy when you've got money... Or, it makes life easier, at least. Ah, does that make me a bad person?


Option1a:: Why is that?

Option1b:: What if you made that a new goal?

Response1a:: Maybe because I'm busy. But, also maybe because I haven't found anything good to read? It's hard to tell.

Response1b:: Sure, I actually feel like I can take on a new goal right now. Will you choose the book for me? I really like adventure novels!


Option2a:: No, you're right. Being comfortable is important. //Relationship Liam9 2 Happy

Option2b:: Money doesn't buy happiness, Liam. //Relationship Liam9 -1

Response2a:: Oh, phew. I thought for sure you'd think I was a greedy person.

Response2b:: Maybe not, but a lack of money sure can make life harder.
