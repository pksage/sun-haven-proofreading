Giuseppe Cycle 2

Dialogue:: Fine art is a satisfying form of expression, but farming seems pretty creative too.


Option1:: How is farming creative?

Option2:: What other kinds of art do you do?


Response1:: You're over there growing living things all day. If you ask me, making a living thing is as creative as it gets!

Response2:: I've dabbled here and there over the years. I've done my share of painting, and still do. I also used to whittle, but I stopped because I kept cutting my fingers.


Option1a:: That's true, it's very rewarding. //Relationship Giuseppe2 2

Option1b:: I don't think of it like that. //Relationship Giuseppe2 -1

Response1a:: I know how you feel. My art is fulfilling too, but it's nothing compared to having Topi. He's my best work yet!

Response1b:: Ah, maybe you're not much of an artist then.


Option2a:: What's your favorite art form?

Option2b:: How do you choose which art form to practice?

Response2a:: I haven't been sculpting that long, but I'm completely obsessed with it. I'm probably just in the honeymoon phase, though. I'm sure I'll discover something new in a couple months.

Response2b:: When something new finds me, I become completely obsessed with it. I know I'm just in the honeymoon phase with sculpting right now.  I'll probably discover something new in a couple months.
