Slobert Cycle 4

Dialogue:: Huh? What do you want? Aren't I rude, huh? 


Option1:: I wanted to ask what's up.

Option2:: What's your favorite place in Withergate?


Response1:: Buh. You're like Donovan. You keep talking to me. You're WEIRD!

Response2:: The carnival is alright. But it's got NOTHIN' on the sewers. Except there's a bunch of monsters down there.


Option1a:: I think we could be friends. //Relationship Slobert3 2 

Option1b:: Slimes aren't so bad. //Relationship Slobert3 2

Response1a:: Do you? Huh. Maybe. I guess you're cool, too.

Response1b:: You got that right. Slimes are the BEST! The best! But I guess the other races are cool, too.


Option2a:: I can take care of the monsters. 

Option2b:: What's so great about the sewers? 

Response2a:: Yeah, think you're strong enough? There's a lot down there. The city guards can't do anything about it!

Response2b:: Dank, full of sludge... it's a paradise! If you're a Slime - which is to say, if you have a cultured taste.
