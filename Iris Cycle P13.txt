Iris Cycle P13

Dialogue:: I've heard tales that Withergate is a city in eternal darkness. How depressing that must be.

Option1:: Do you not like the night?
Option2:: The people living in Withergate must love it.

Response1:: Well, no, that's not it. I quite like night, actually. It gives life a chance to rest. It also allows other types of life to flourish, under the light of the stars.[]But eternal night? Without ever seeing the sun? So many plants and animals would perish. I don't think I'd fare any better, either.
Response2:: Maybe they do. I suppose I can't judge, but still... the thought of endless night gives me a chill. Is it true that Demons cannot tolerate sunlight?[]The sun is the giver of energy and life. It's odd to imagine anyone could live without it.

Option1a:: Good thing you're in Nel'Vari!
Option1b:: You don't sound cut out for Withergate. //Emote none Embarrassed

Response1a:: Yes, I'm comfortable as can be right where I am. I was born for Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!
Response1b:: You aren't making fun of me, are you, XX? I love living in Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!

Option2a:: Think of how life must have adapted to the dark. //Relationship IrisP13 2 Happy
Option2b:: You sound pretty judgmental. //Relationship IrisP13 -1 Sad

Response2a:: That's a good point. Surely there must be plenty of flora and fauna in and around this Withergate. Life tends to find a way, even if it's living in an endless night.
Response2b:: Do I? I'm not trying to be, but the concept is just so strange to me. I'm sorry, I just have a hard time grasping it.
