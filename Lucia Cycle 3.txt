Dialogue:: Good day, XX. I have a spot of free time if you would like to chat.[]Is there anything you'd like to know?

Option1:: I'm curious... what's your favorite dessert?

Option2:: So is your hair naturally red, or is that magic too?


Response1:: There's a delectable dish I've only ever found in other regions. It's called moon cream pie. If you have the opportunity to try it, I recommend that you do!
