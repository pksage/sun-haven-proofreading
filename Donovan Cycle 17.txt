Donovan Cycle 17

Dialogue:: I love your scent. I can smell you a mile away!

Option1:: Can you really smell me from a mile away?
Option2:: What's my scent smell like?

Response1:: Well not an <i>actual</i> mile. It's a figure of speech, I think. But I really do smell you before I see you... I don't know, maybe a couple blocks away?
Response2:: It's a nice mix of fresh dirt and sweat. And maybe a hint of the beach. Is your farm close to the ocean?

Option1a:: That's not very far. //Relationship Donovan17 -1 Mad
Option1b:: That's still pretty far! //Relationship Donovan17 2

Response1a:: I'm sorry, I didn't realize my nose was under review. Say, how far does your nose smell?
Response1b:: You think? Heh, thanks! It's not always a good thing though. I can smell Slobert halfway across the city...

Option2a:: Hey, that's pretty good! //Emote none Happy
Option2b:: I'm right next to the beach, actually. //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i> 
Response2b:: Yeah, I thought so! I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i>
