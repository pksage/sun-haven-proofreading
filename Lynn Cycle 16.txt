Lynn Cycle 16

Dialogue:: "Lynn, the farmer's wife", oh, I still get giddy when I say it!

Option1:: I married the pretty blacksmith.

Option2:: Did you ever think you'd marry a farmer?


Response1:: Farmer and blacksmith really seem to fit together, don't they? That has to settle it, it was fate that we met each other, XX!

Response2:: I honestly didn't know who I'd marry. I never thought I'd leave home, really. Back in my village, it's customary for the women to choose their husbands and propose marriage.[]I never saw myself feeling confident enough to do something like that, but before you proposed, I secretly chose you![]To myself, anyways. So I guess I sort of adhered to traditon?


Option1a:: I really don't think it was fate. //Relationship Lynn16 -1 Embarrassed

Option1b:: Whatever it was, it brought you to me. //Relationship Lynn16 2 Happy

Response1a:: ...Yeah, I guess it's silly to think it was 'fate'. But I'm still glad we met on that train.

Response1b:: And me to you, XX. Oh, now I'm feeling all giddy again...


Option2a:: You "secretly" chose me? You're so adorable. //Relationship Lynn16 2 Romantic

Option2b:: You should've proposed to me!

Response2a:: Hey, you ended up proposing, didn't you? Good thing too, because I'm not sure I would have made a mess of it if I tried to!

Response2b:: Ooh, I know, it's tradition for my village!! You can't ever tell my mother, alright? She'd never let me hear the end of it!
