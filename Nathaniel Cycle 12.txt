Dialogue:: I hope you're staying out of trouble - it would look bad if I was dating a criminal!

Option1:: You mean you wouldn't cover for me?

Option2:: Have you ever gotten into serious trouble before?


Response1:: Luckily it won't come to that, because you're a good citizen who doesn't commit crimes. Right?

Response2:: The most trouble I ever got into was as a kid. I stole a toy slingshot by hiding it in my pants.[]I didn't even make it out of the store before they caught me. The sling was still hanging out the back of my pants. I guess I wasn't cut out to be a criminal.

Option2a:: What happened to you?

Option2b:: Did you feel guilty?

Response2a:: I felt terrible after getting caught. My mom didn't yell at me or anything, but she was completely disappointed. In a way, that was much worse than being yelled at.[]And, of course, she grounded me for a month.
