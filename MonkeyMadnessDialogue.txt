Monkey Madness

Dialogue:: XX! I've heard good things about you. Supposedly you have a variety of skills. I'm hoping one of those skills is combat.

Option1:: What's going on?

Option2(Permanent):: What do you need me to do?


Response1:: Those darned monkeys are causing trouble for travelers. They're too dangerous. We need to do something.

Response2:: Slay 10 monkeys in the eastern forest, and that's it. Hopefully the rest will get the message. Come find me when you're done and I'll gladly pay you.


Option2a:: I'm on it! //Quest none MonkeyMadnessQuest

Option2b:: I'm too busy to help right now.


Response2a:: I can't wait to teach these monkeys a lesson. (End)

Response2b:: That's disappointing. Hopefully someone else will step up to the challenge. (End)
