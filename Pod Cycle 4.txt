Pod Cycle 4

Dialogue:: I found a anthill under the tree over there. I want to show Emma!


Option1:: Are you good friends with Emma?

Option2:: You should ask Liam if she can come over.


Response1:: Yeah! Except her brother Liam doesn't let her play as much as me and Topi. I wish we were neighbors, too.

Response2:: But then Elizabeth will come over too. Topi has a crush on Elizabeth and then he doesn't play with me. I hate it!


Option1a:: Do you see her in school?

Option1b:: You think she would like the anthill?

Response1a:: Yes, but we don't get to look at anthills in school.

Response1b:: Yeah, I know it! She likes bugs and cool stuff like that.


Option2a:: Think of it this way - then you get more time to play with Emma. //Relationship Pod4 2

Option2b:: You need to let him play with Elizabeth too. //Relationship Pod4 -1

Response2a:: I guess so. Emma is fun too. Sometimes she brings breads that her brother made and they taste sweet!

Response2b:: Nooooo... Why is everything so hard?
