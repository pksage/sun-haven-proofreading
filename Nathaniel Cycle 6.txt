Nathaniel Cycle 6

Dialogue:: Hey XX, taking a break from farming? It's healthy to have interests outside of work.

Option1:: I was wondering, if you weren't a soldier then what job would you want?

Option2:: Do you have a hobby outside of work?


Response1:: That's a good question. I would still want to help people somehow, that's for sure. I think I'd like building houses.

Response2:: I don't know if it counts as a hobby, but I'm pretty good at skipping stones across the lake.[]There's something about it that's mesmerizing. It should sink, but it skips instead. It's like a little miracle![]Does that make any sense, or am I just talking nonsense?


Option1a:: That's a surprising choice.

Option1b:: That makes perfect sense for you! //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid. At least, back when there was still some forested land left in the Great City. Now the Great City is all roads.

Response1b:: You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid.[]Now the Great City is all roads, so there's nowhere left to make forts.


Option2a:: It makes sense to me. //Relationship Nathaniel6 2 Happy

Option2b:: That does sound a little silly. //Relationship Nathaniel6 -1 Sad

Response2a:: Oh yeah? Well don't get me wrong - I know it comes down to good hand-eye coordination. But I like to think that the rock actually skips because it refuses to sink.[]Hey, I haven't told that to anyone!

Response2b:: Yeah, I know. I guess being a little silly just helps lift my spirits, sometimes.
