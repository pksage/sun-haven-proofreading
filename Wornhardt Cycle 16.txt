Wornhardt Cycle 16

Dialogue:: XX, have you lost weight? I thought we were supposed to <i>gain</i> weight after we got married.

Option1:: Is that good medical advice?
Option2:: Are you worried about putting on a few pounds?

Response1:: It's not really medical advice, but it's something I've noticed with married couples. Many of them gain a little weight after being married - I see it as a sign of happiness!
Response2:: Ah! You noticed??[]I don't get as much exercise as you, XX, that's for sure. Maybe I should join Tonya on her morning runs...

Option1a:: I'm plenty happy, Wornhardt, even if I don't gain any weight. //Emote none Happy
Option1b:: We're not like other married couples. //Emote none Happy

Response1a:: Heh, well, that's good to hear! Hm, maybe I should weigh myself at the hospital...
Response1b:: Heheh, is that what you think?[]I always thought of us as something special, too. I wonder if everyone feels this way?

Option2a:: That would probably be good for you. //Relationship Wornhardt16 -1 Sad
Option2b:: Nonsense - you look good! //Relationship Wornhardt16 2 //Emote none Happy

Response2a:: You know, XX, there are gentler ways to tell somebody to lose weight.
Response2b:: Oh! Hah, well now that you mention it, I am a good weight for my height. But I'll keep an eye on it to be sure I stay healthy, of course!
