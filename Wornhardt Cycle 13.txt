Wornhardt Cycle 13

Dialogue:: Ever since we got together, I've been gaining weight. It's good - I was a little skinny before.

Option1:: I thought you looked a little healthier.

Option2:: Since we're together, do I get free medical care?


Response1:: Oh yeah? Well, feel free to mention it next time! I'm not opposed to flattery, you know. Who doesn't enjoy a nice compliment?

Response2:: I still have to make a living, you know. Unless you want to take over paying my bills?


Option1a:: Alright then - nobody wears a white cloak like you do! //Relationship Wornhardt13 2 Happy

Option1b:: I don't want your head getting too big. //Relationship Wornhardt13 -1 Mad

Response1a:: Despite the fact that nobody in Sun Haven wears a white cloak other than me, I'll take the compliment. Haha, thank you, XX!

Response1b:: Is this a legitimate concern of yours? I'm a grown man, XX. I know how to handle my own ego.


Option2a:: You're on your own there, Wornhardt. //Emote none Happy

Option2b:: I'll always support you, including paying your bills if I have to.

Response2a:: Haha, I think I'll manage! A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.

Response2b:: Thank goodness it won't come to that. A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.
