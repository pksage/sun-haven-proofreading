Iris Cycle 11

Dialogue:: You're looking stronger and stronger every time I see you, XX. I guess that's because of your farm work, huh?

Option1:: I hope you get to see my farm one day. //Emote none Happy

Option2:: I'd really like to go out with you again, Iris.


Response1:: I would like that, XX. It will just take a little time, is all. I hope you'll be patient with me.

Response2:: Really? I was thinking the same thing, XX...


Option1a:: Sometimes you just need to take a chance. //Relationship Iris11 -1 Sad

Option1b:: Take all the time you need, Iris. //Relationship Iris11 2 Happy

Response1a:: Sometimes... maybe. But this doesn't feel like one of those times.

Response1b:: Thanks, XX. I knew I could count on you.


Option2a:: Perfect! //Quest none IrisHangout2Quest

Option2b:: Actually, I'll have to pass on this one. //Emote none Sad

Response2a:: Let's meet at my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow. I'm excited to see you there!

Response2b:: Oh, okay. I'm sorry, I guess I just thought... Well, never mind.
